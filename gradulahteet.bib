In this chapter, we review five socialization practices that have received the most attention in the socialization literature: orientation programs, training programs, socialization tactics, job characteristics, and socialization agents. We conclude that as a whole, the socialization literature remains fragmented, undeveloped, and incomplete, as it has failed to adequately identify and study the socialization practices used by organizations today. In an effort to address these limitations, we review the practitioner literature and provide examples of what several organizations do to socialize their new hires. Based on this information in combination with the research literature, we then introduce a new, more complete and integrated approach to organizational socialization called Socialization Resources Theory (SRT). Socialization Resources Theory focuses on the resources that newcomers require for a successful adjustment and socialization. We describe 17 socialization resources that organizations can provide before entry, immediately after entry, during the first 6 months of the socialization process, and after the formal socialization period. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the implications of SRT for socialization theory, research, and practice.}",

The onboarding “best practices” conveyed through practitioner outlets generally do not provide sufficient prescription to implement policies or programs that will achieve desired outcomes.

Using the Klein and Heuser (2008 ) Inform-Welcome-Guide framework, we first examine the available insights from the academic literature. We then review the practitioner literature and identify the common recommendations that are made regarding onboarding best practices. We also summarize a recent survey conducted to gain a clearer picture of what organizations are currently doing with respect to onboarding practices.

It is a dynamic process that occurs when an individual assumes a new or changing role within an organization. A description of general socialization within the field of psychology is presented as a background for the study of organizational socialization. Four theories: uncertainty reduction theory, the need to belong, social exchange theory, and social identity theory are presented as theoretical foundations for organizational socialization. Against this background, the basic components of organizational socialization—its processes, content, and outcomes—are reviewed. Emphasis is given to organizational and individual tactics used to facilitate socialization, as well as to the specific content of what is learned. Finally, a blueprint for future research directions is presented to address current gaps in a general model of organizational socialization. In particular, a call for research to understand how organizations learn from the socialization process is presented to balance the study of work adjustment from individual and organizational perspectives.}",

@article{bauer-ym-2007,
    Abstract = {The authors tested a model of antecedents and outcomes of newcomer adjustment using 70 unique samples of newcomers with meta-analytic and path modeling techniques. Specifically, they proposed and tested a model in which adjustment (role clarity, self-efficacy, and social acceptance) mediated the effects of organizational socialization tactics and information seeking on socialization outcomes (job satisfaction, organizational commitment, job performance, intentions to remain, and turnover). The results generally supported this model. In addition, the authors examined the moderating effects of methodology on these relationships by coding for 3 methodological issues: data collection type (longitudinal vs. cross-sectional), sample characteristics (school-to-work vs. work-to-work transitions), and measurement of the antecedents (facet vs. composite measurement). Discussion focuses on the implications of the findings and suggestions for future research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 AP},

We advocate that using a carefully designed social learning network can reduce the learning time for enterprise software developers and consultants. By viewing learning as a social act, a consulting company can increase its productivity. Increased productivity is based on hastening the learning process. The focus of this paper is to identify the ways in which social networks catalyze the process of knowledge sharing in order to increase the productivity in the enterprise resource planning (ERP) consulting sector. We present a set of detailed practical results that were obtained from experiments with an original knowledge sharing method that was applied to training young software developers to enable them to work for some of the world’s most demanding IT companies. The experimental data were collected from 2004 to 2011 during 12 training sessions conducted by an IBM partner in conjunction with the Computer Science Department of a large Eastern European University. The main results of this study were: (1) designed a learning community that reduced the time needed to insert junior consultants into ERP projects; and (2) statistical data were generated that measured the increase in productivity that an ERP consulting company could obtain by employing organizational learning networks. We also discuss the positive impacts of social networks that can be established between private companies and universities.}

In this paper, we present findings from a qualitative case study of five software teams that hired and onboarded their first remote team member. Our analyses focus on three underappreciated aspects of the virtual onboarding process: trying to learn team practices as the team changes them, building and maintaining social relationships with physically remote teammates, and evaluating and managing expectations of performance from afar. From the results of our analyses, we pose seven propositions about virtual onboarding that should be explored in future studies.},

    abstract = {Cultivating communities of practice becomes an important goal in the workplaces to promote organizational and professional development. Software development communities, with the challenges that the vertiginous evolution of technologies and the new organizational forms of the software industry suppose, are failing to enable participation of newcomers. The lack of empirical and holistic experiences to guide managers to launch and maintain communities of practice in software development motivates this study. We are also concerned with the limited perspective with which participation is defined and measured in software development studies.The goal of the research is to design a model of participation in software development communities of practice. Specifically with this work, we aim to discuss the fundamentals sustaining the model and to present the methodology conducted to design and validate it. To obtain its first version, we conducted a methodology based on the theoretical analysis and synthesis of the related literature. In order to validate it, we designed a three-phase methodology comprising interview-based, expert-based and fuzz-cognitive-maps-based validations. By now, we have executed the interview-based study. The model that we already obtained includes contributions of other models, but it also achieves a multidimensional perspective of the phenomenon. The analysis of the interviews has enabled us to have an empirical notion of participation from different regions and workplace conditions.},
