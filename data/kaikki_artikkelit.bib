abstract = {Software development teams dedicate considerable resources to training newcomers. Newcomers are new developers to a software project. The software onboarding process is more complicated than onboarding into other organizations. It is much more challenging and time-consuming. The role of a mentor in onboarding newcomers in software engineering is well understood. However, the disruptions to the work of an experienced developer can reduce the quality of their work and job satisfaction. We propose a conversational bot that can help onboard newcomers to a software project instead of an experienced programmer. The bot will act as a mentor for the newcomer, thus putting less stress on experienced programmers. The bot will also be able to scan outside sources, such as stack overflow, for solutions to issues a newcomer may face. The newcomer will be able to interact with the bot using natural language. We will use this bot to assess improvements to code quality in future studies.},

abstract = {Mentor [men-tawr, -ter] noun 1. a wise and trusted counselor or teacher. 2. an influential senior sponsor or supporter.Experiential learning is one of the best ways to train your new information technology (IT) staff including the student staff. In an IT environment, however, scheduling the required participants and having a formalized training session for all topics may seem impossible. Retention levels increase if the participants can "engage" in the activities rather than just watching the content online, reading documents or participating in a lecture-style-PowerPoint session. Mentoring can be utilized in a dynamic training environment such as training new IT staff.At Grinnell College, we have taken advantage of mentoring as our main type of IT training provided to IT staff, including the student staff, Technology Consultants (TCs). There are many advantages of using a mentor system to train new staff as it not only allows a real-time training experience, but also builds relationships with the current staff. Through the use of mentor and mentee orientation, mentoring guides, scheduled mentored shifts and evaluations, our mentoring program has proven to be successful in training new staff members.The IT mentor program has evolved into a successful part of training at Grinnell College and seems to be a way to have new staff members engage in their new duties immediately, while pacing new information in an organized and appropriate way; along with building relationships with new team members.},

abstract = {Successfully onboarding open source projects in GitHub is difficult for developers, because it is time-consuming for them to search an expected project by a few query words from numerous repositories, and developers suffer from various social and technical barriers in joined projects. Frequently failed onboarding postpones developers' development schedule, and the evolutionary progress of open source projects. To mitigate developers' costly efforts for onboarding, we propose a ranking model NNLRank (Neural Network for List-wise Ranking) to recommend projects that developers are likely to contribute many commits. Based on 9 measured project features, NNLRank learns a ranking function (represented by a neural network, optimized by a list-wise ranking loss function) to score a list of candidate projects, where top-n scored candidates are recommended to a target developer. We evaluate NNLRank by 2044 succeeded onboarding decisions from GitHub developers, comparing with a related model LP (Link Prediction), and 3 other typical ranking models. Results show that NNLRank can provide developers with effective recommendation, substantially outperforming baselines.},

abstract = {Inexperienced software developers - for example, undergraduates entering the workforce - exhibit a lack of testing skills. They have trouble understanding and applying basic testing techniques. These inexperienced developers are hired by software companies, where this lack of testing skills has already been recognized. Companies allocate valuable resources and invest time and money in different onboarding strategies to introduce new hires to the organization’s testing practices. However, if the lack of testing skills is not addressed properly, the new hire is left to her own devices. This hinders her in becoming a high-quality engineer for the software company. This thesis proposes to improve the onboarding strategies with traits of social transparency in order to specifically address testing issues of inexperienced new hires. Social transparency has been shown to influence the testing behavior of development teams on a social coding site. An environment that is open for discussion helps newcomers to understand and adapt a team’s testing culture. Tailoring the onboarding process to better address testing skills of new hires makes it more effective and more efficient. This reduces the danger of carrying new hire’s testing deficits into commercial software development.},

abstract = {The co-existence of various kinds of devices, protocols, architectures, and programming languages make Internet of Things (IoT) systems complex to develop, even for experienced programmers. Perforce, Software Engineering challenges are even more difficult to address by novice programmers. Previous research focused on identifying the most challenging issues that novice programmers experience when developing IoT systems. The results suggested that the integration of heterogeneous software components is one of the most painful issues, mainly due to the lack of documentation understandable by inexperienced developers, from both conceptual and technical perspectives. In fact, novice programmers devote a significant effort looking for documentation and code samples willing to understand them conceptually, or in the worst case, at least to make them work. Driven by the research question: "How do the lessons learned by IoT novice programmers can be captured, so they become an asset for other novice developers?", in this paper, we introduce Code Recipes. They consist of summarized and well-defined documentation modules, independent from programming languages or run-time environments, by which non-expert programmers can smoothly become familiar with source code, written by other developers that faced similar issues. Through a use case, we show how Code Recipes are a feasible mechanism to support novice IoT programmers in building their IoT systems.},

We have implemented portions of the concept as plugins for the Atom code editor and conducted informal surveys with students and instructors. Next steps include deploying the tool prototype to students enrolled in introductory programming courses.},

Applicants were poorly motivated or lacked the aptitude for technical training and required remedial training to bring them up to par. To remedy this at the beginning rather than the end of the hiring cycle when it was too late, we came up with the idea of training applicants and giving them the resources to train themselves before we hired them and then using their success at training themselves as one of the determinants in hiring them as computing consultants.We found that, generally, inverting our training program resulted in substantial savings (both in student wages and staff time), produced a higher quality candidate, and created a competitive environment that motivated candidates to learn and attracted more qualified candidates to the position.},

Open source software projects are becoming increasingly more popular. Many major companies have started building open source software. Unfortunately, many newcomers only commit once to an open source project before moving on to another project. Even worse, many novices struggle with joining open source communities and end up leaving quickly, sometimes before their first successful contribution. In this paper, we propose a conversational bot that would recommend projects to newcomers and assist in the onboarding to the open source community. The bot would be able to provide helpful resources, such as Stack Overflow related content. It would also be able to recommend human mentors. We believe that this bot would improve newcomers' experience by providing support not only during their first contribution, but by acting as an agent to engage them to the project.},

abstract = {With a volatile labour and technological market, onboarding is becoming increasingly important. The process of incorporating a new developer, a.k.a. the newcomer, into a software development team is reckoned to be lengthy, frustrating and expensive. Newcomers face personal, interpersonal, process and technical barriers during their incorporation, which, in turn, affects the overall productivity of the whole team. This problem exacerbates for Software Product Lines (SPLs), where their size and variability combine to make onboarding even more challenging, even more so for developers that are transferred from the Application Engineering team into the Domain Engineering team, who will be our target newcomers. This work presents concept maps on the role of sensemaking scaffolds to help to introduce these newcomers into the SPL domain. Concept maps, used as knowledge visualisation tools, have been proven to be helpful for meaningful learning. Our main insight is to capture concepts of the SPL domain and their interrelationships in a concept map, and then, present them incrementally, helping newcomers grasp the SPL and aiding them in exploring it in a guided manner while avoiding information overload. This work's contributions are four-fold. First, concept maps are proposed as a representation to introduce newcomers into the SPL domain. Second, concept maps are presented as the means for a guided exploration of the SPL core assets. Third, a feature-driven concept map construction process is introduced. Last, the usefulness of concept maps as guides for SPL onboarding is tested through a formative evaluation.Link to the online demo: https://rebrand.ly/wacline-cmap},

abstract = {Well-trained machine-learning models, which leverage large amounts of open-source software data, have now become an interesting approach to automating many software engineering tasks. Several SE tasks have all been subject to this approach, with performance gradually improving over the past several years with better models and training methods. More, and more diverse, clean, labeled data is better for training; but constructing good-quality datasets is time-consuming and challenging. Ways of augmenting the volume and diversity of clean, labeled data generally have wide applicability. For some languages (e.g., Ruby) labeled data is less abundant; in others (e.g., JavaScript) the available data maybe more focused on some application domains, and thus less diverse. As a way around such data bottlenecks, we present evidence suggesting that human-written code in different languages (which performs the same function), is rather similar, and particularly preserving of identifier naming patterns; we further present evidence suggesting that identifiers are a very important element of training data for software engineering tasks. We leverage this rather fortuitous phenomenon to find evidence that available multilingual training data (across different languages) can be used to amplify performance. We study this for 3 different tasks: code summarization, code retrieval, and function naming. We note that this data-augmenting approach is broadly compatible with different tasks, languages, and machine-learning models.},

In this paper, we present the results of a controlled 11-week longitudinal study with 57 CS1 students comparing two skill-based interventions to improve programming performance. The first intervention involves spatial training, an established baseline known to be helpful in engineering contexts. The second intervention is a novel CS-focused technical reading training. In our reading training, we teach strategies for summarizing scientific papers and understanding scientific charts and figures; most of the covered readings were CS1-accessible portions of computer science research papers. For the spatial training, we use a standardized training curriculum previously found to improve programming skills by focusing on spatial ability (i.e., the ability to mentally manipulate objects). We first replicate findings that both reading ability and spatial ability correlate with programming success. Significantly, however, we find that those in our reading training exhibit larger programming ability gains than those in the standard spatial training (p = 0.02, f2=0.10). We also find that reading trained participants perform particularly well on programming problems that require tracing through code (p = 0.03, f2=0.10). Our results suggest that technical reading training could be beneficial for novice programmers. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for future CS1 interventions, the possibility for non-programming based training to positively impact developers, and future directions for software engineering education research.},

In a large-scale experiment, we compare student performance when tutored by human tutors, and when receiving automated adaptive feedback. The automated feedback was designed using one of two well-known instructional principles: (i) presenting the correct solution for the immediate problem, or (ii) presenting generated examples or analogies that guide towards the correct solution. We report empirical results from a large-scale (N = 480, 10,000 + person hour) experiment assessing the efficacy of these automated compilation-error feedback tools. Using the survival analysis on error rates of students measured over seven weeks, we found that automated feedback allows students to resolve errors in their code more efficiently than students receiving manual feedback. However, we also found that this advantage is primarily logistical and not conceptual; the performance benefit seen during lab assignments disappeared during exams wherein feedback of any kind was withdrawn. We further found that the performance advantage of automated feedback over human tutors increases with problem complexity, and that feedback via example and specific repair have distinct, non-overlapping relative advantages for different categories of programming errors. Our results offer a clear and granular delimitation of the pedagogical benefits of automated feedback in teaching programming to novices.},

Then, when a newcomer joins the project, Yoda recommends her a mentor that, among the available ones, has already discussed topics relevant for the newcomer.Yoda has been evaluated on software repositories of five open source projects. We have also surveyed some developers of these projects to understand whether mentoring was actually performed in their projects, and asked them to evaluate the mentoring relations Yoda identified. Results indicate that top committers are not always the most appropriate mentors, and show the potential usefulness of Yoda as a recommendation system to aid project managers in supporting newcomers joining a software project.},

abstract = {Developers frequently move into new teams or environments across software companies. Their onboarding experience is correlated with productivity, job satisfaction, and other short-term and long-term outcomes. The majority of the onboarding process comprises engineering tasks such as fixing bugs or implementing small features. Nevertheless, we do not have a systematic view of how tasks influence onboarding. In this paper, we present a case study of Microsoft, where we interviewed 32 developers moving into a new team and 15 engineering managers onboarding a new developer into their team - to understand and characterize developers' onboarding experience and expectations in relation to the tasks performed by them while onboarding. We present how tasks interact with new developers through three representative themes: learning, confidence building, and socialization. We also discuss three onboarding strategies as inferred from the interviews that managers commonly use unknowingly, and discuss their pros and cons and offer situational recommendations. Furthermore, we triangulate our interview findings with a developer survey (N = 189) and a manager survey (N = 37) and find that survey results suggest that our findings are representative and our recommendations are actionable. Practitioners could use our findings to improve their onboarding processes, while researchers could find new research directions from this study to advance the understanding of developer onboarding.

abstract = {Query spelling correction is a crucial component of modern search engines. Existing methods in the literature for search query spelling correction have two major drawbacks. First, they are unable to handle certain important types of spelling errors, such as concatenation and splitting. Second, they cannot efficiently evaluate all the candidate corrections due to the complex form of their scoring functions, and a heuristic filtering step must be applied to select a working set of top-K most promising candidates for final scoring, leading to non-optimal predictions. In this paper we address both limitations and propose a novel generalized Hidden Markov Model with discriminative training that can not only handle all the major types of spelling errors, including splitting and concatenation errors, in a single unified framework, but also efficiently evaluate all the candidate corrections to ensure the finding of a globally optimal correction. Experiments on two query spelling correction datasets demonstrate that the proposed generalized HMM is effective for correcting multiple types of spelling errors. The results also show that it significantly outperforms the current approach for generating top-K candidate corrections, making it a better first-stage filter to enable any other complex spelling correction algorithm to have access to a better working set of candidate corrections as well as to cover splitting and concatenation errors, which no existing method in academic literature can correct.},

Youngness as well as poor high-order-driving-skills (HODS) are associated with the ND over-representation in road crashes [28]. Most studies focusing on road risks in newly licensed drivers use data referring to crash situations [37], but little is known about difficulties they experience daily while driving. This paper reports the first results of an exploratory study on difficult situations experienced by ND during their first months of driving. 48 young ND were interviewed using the Critical Incident Technique. 92 Critical incidents were obtained representing a wide set of perceived-as-difficult situations by ND that goes beyond typical road crash or near-crash situations. The analysis suggests that poor HODS, lack of collective driving skills and cognitive load due to inexperience might also explain these difficult situations. We plan to clarify the HODS involved in all the collected difficult situations while considering the framework of non-technical-skills (NTS) [14] for the development of training scenario for simulation-based driving education and assessment.},

Such categorization becomes critical if the system is to return results not just from a general web collection but from topic-specific databases as well. Maintaining sufficient categorization recall is very difficult as web queries are typically short, yielding few features per query. We examine three approaches to topical categorization of general web queries: matching against a list of manually labeled queries, supervised learning of classifiers, and mining of selectional preference rules from large unlabeled query logs. Each approach has its advantages in tackling the web query classification recall problem, and combining the three techniques allows us to classify a substantially larger proportion of queries than any of the individual techniques. We examine the performance of each approach on a real web query stream and show that our combined method accurately classifies 46% of queries, outperforming the recall of the best single approach by nearly 20%, with a 7% improvement in overall effectiveness.},

abstract = {The cold start problem is a long-standing challenge in recommender systems. That is, how to recommend for new users and new items without any historical interaction record? Recent ML-based approaches have made promising strides versus traditional methods. These ML approaches typically combine both user-item interaction data of existing warm start users and items (as in CF-based methods) with auxiliary information of users and items such as user profiles and item content information (as in content-based methods). However, such approaches face key drawbacks including the error superimposition issue that the auxiliary-to-CF transformation error increases the final recommendation error; the ineffective learning issue that long distance from transformation functions to model output layer leads to ineffective model learning; and the unified transformation issue that applying the same transformation function for different users and items results in poor transformation.Hence, this paper proposes a novel model designed to overcome these drawbacks while delivering strong cold start performance. Three unique features are: (i) a combined separate-training and joint-training framework to overcome the error superimposition issue and improve model quality; (ii) a Randomized Training mechanism to promote the effectiveness of model learning; and (iii) a Mixture-of-Experts Transformation mechanism to provide 'personalized' transformation functions. Extensive experiments on three datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed model over state-of-the-art alternatives.},

abstract = {In order to give students an authentic learning experience and better prepare them for the life-long learning required in contemporary workplaces, educational institutions increasingly use project-based learning in teams. However, this poses the challenge of developing authentic and equitable assessment criteria that reflect individual contributions in a team-work setting without jeopardizing project outcomes. We present a novel and innovative portfolio-based assessment framework that focuses on qualitative outcomes and ensures that the level of achievement reflects a student's competency across each of the defined learning dimensions, including professional behaviour, teamwork, process and relevant contributions towards project deliverables. In this paper, we present the main motivation behind devising and introducing the framework and also reflect on the educational outcomes and challenges of implementing the framework in the context of two final year Software Engineering project units.},

abstract = {Nowadays, we are witnessing an increasing effort to improve the performance and trustworthiness of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), with the aim to enable their adoption in safety critical systems such as self-driving cars or aircraft collision-avoidance systems. Multiple testing techniques are proposed to generate test cases that can expose inconsistencies in the behavior of DNN models. These techniques assume implicitly that the training program is bug-free and appropriately configured. However, satisfying this assumption for a novel problem requires significant engineering work to prepare the data, design the DNN, implement the training program, and tune the hyperparameters in order to produce the model for which current automated test data generators search for corner-case behaviors. All these model training steps can be error-prone. Therefore, it is crucial to detect and correct errors throughout all the engineering steps of DNN-based software systems and not only on the resulting DNN model. In this paper, we gather a catalog of training issues and based on their symptoms and their effects on the behavior of the training program, we propose practical verification routines to detect the aforementioned issues, automatically, by continuously validating that some important properties of the learning dynamics hold during the training. Then, we design, TheDeepChecker, an end-to-end property-based debugging approach for DNN training programs and implement it as a TensorFlow-based library. As an empirical evaluation, we conduct a case study to assess the effectiveness of TheDeepChecker on synthetic and real-world buggy DL programs and compare its performance to that of the Amazon SageMaker Debugger (SMD). Results show that TheDeepChecker’s on-execution validation of DNN-based program’s properties through three sequential phases (pre-, on-, and post-fitting), succeeds in revealing several coding bugs and system misconfigurations errors, early on and at a low cost. Moreover, our property-based approach outperforms the SMD’s offline rules verification on training logs in terms of detection accuracy for unstable learning issues and coverage of additional DL bugs.},

Experimentation, a process of testing hypotheses about the product, helps these companies to reduce uncertainty through different evidence-based approaches.

HyMap is a technique where a facilitator helps a software startup founder to draw a cognitive map representing her understanding of the context and, based on that, create hypotheses about the software to be built. In this paper, we present the Digital Mentor, an working-in-progress conversational bot to help creating a HyMap without the need of a human facilitator.

abstract = {Due to the promising future of Automated Program Repair (APR), researchers have proposed various APR techniques, including heuristic-based, template-based, and constraint-based techniques. Among such classic APR techniques, template-based techniques have been widely recognized as state of the art. However, such template-based techniques require predefined templates to perform repair, and their effectiveness is thus limited. To this end, researchers have leveraged the recent advances in Deep Learning to further improve APR. Such learning-based techniques typically view APR as a Neural Machine Translation problem, using the buggy/fixed code snippets as the source/target languages for translation. In this way, such techniques heavily rely on large numbers of high-quality bug-fixing commits, which can be extremely costly/challenging to construct and may limit their edit variety and context representation. In this paper, we aim to revisit the learning-based APR problem, and propose AlphaRepair, the first cloze-style (or infilling-style) APR approach to directly leveraging large pre-trained code models for APR without any fine-tuning/retraining on historical bug fixes. Our main insight is instead of modeling what a repair edit should look like (i.e., a NMT task), we can directly predict what the correct code is based on the context information (i.e., a cloze or text infilling task). Although our approach is general and can be built on various pre-trained code models, we have implemented AlphaRepair as a practical multilingual APR tool based on the recent CodeBERT model. Our evaluation of AlphaRepair on the widely used Defects4J benchmark shows for the first time that learning-based APR without any history bug fixes can already outperform state-of-the-art APR techniques. We also studied the impact of different design choices and show that AlphaRepair performs even better on a newer version of Defects4J (2.0) with 3.3X more fixes than best performing baseline, indicating that AlphaRepair can potentially avoid the dataset-overfitting issue of existing techniques. Additionally, we demonstrate the multilingual repair ability of AlphaRepair by evaluating on the QuixBugs dataset where AlphaRepair achieved the state-of-the-art results on both Java and Python versions.},

abstract = {At SIGUCCS 2001 in Portland, OR, I presented a paper entitled "Invert Your Training Program: Have Applicants Train Themselves Before You Hire" in which I outlined an innovative training program for new hires where we trained first and hired only those who trained the best. Although there were substantial cost and quality improvements in that process, there were still some labor-intensive aspects, such as interviewing. So, at the end of that paper, I suggested that perhaps we could completely invert the whole process, eliminating training altogether, by testing all who apply and only interviewing those who test well. This would require finding a way of testing 'native' or self-taught ability with computers, but would eliminate technical training altogether. And we wouldn't waste time vetting people in interviews who we were not going to hire for low technical skill level.In this paper, I reprise the original process to highlight the success as well as the shortcomings of that process we discovered over the years we used it. I detail how we decided to revamp this hiring process. I discuss how we made use of online, hands-on testing to permit virtually anyone to have a shot at being a computing consultant with more accurate results. I review in brief the product we used and summarize the results of this exciting new method of selecting and hiring consultants Using hands-on testing software, we have been able to expand our reach across campus to include many applicants who would not have been considered before.},

The unfairness of ML software indicates the software behavior affected by the sensitive features (e.g., sex), which leads to biased and illegal decisions and has become a worthy problem for the whole software engineering community.According to the "data-driven" programming paradigm of ML software, we consider the root cause of the unfairness as biased features in training data. Inspired by software debugging, we propose a novel method, Linear-regression based Training Data Debugging (LTDD), to debug feature values in training data, i.e., (a) identify which features and which parts of them are biased, and (b) exclude the biased parts of such features to recover as much valuable and unbiased information as possible to build fair ML software. We conduct an extensive study on nine data sets and three classifiers to evaluate the effect of our method LTDD compared with four baseline methods. Experimental results show that (a) LTDD can better improve the fairness of ML software with less or comparable damage to the performance, and (b) LTDD is more actionable for fairness improvement in realistic scenarios.},

These OFIs are then translated into improvements projects, which are measured for effectiveness and implemented across the ISU.In the current mentor model of the improvement team, these projects are mentored by Six Sigma Master Black Belts (MBBs). However, there were just two Six Sigma Master Black Belt mentors in the process improvement team, leading to bandwidth constraints as the improvement project count increased. The team size of dedicated mentors needed to be ramped up to cope up with the growing number of improvement projects. Adequately staffing these positions with knowledgeable employees involves cost and continues to be a big challenge for any organisationThe proposed model helps in development of more mentors who are trained in various improvement methodologies such as LEAN, Six Sigma and Change Acceleration Process. Through the proposed model, they are made capable to mentor various improvement projects, help project teams in choosing the right methodology, involve right stakeholders and build a solution that will be well received by all.The new model was deployed in the unit and it has started giving good results. Non-linear growth in Improvement Mentors and associate satisfaction were some of the key benefits that were reaped from this model.},

The results revealed that EEG in frequency domain beta feature of frontal region achieved a high average accuracy. Hence, hybrid EEG-fEMG modality can be used to measure stress level. Moreover, fEMG-based biofeedback training system might be used to relieve stress. In the future, we will test this system on a variety of subjects and implement the proposed fEMG biofeedback training system for a stress relief.},

abstract = {The latest trend of incorporating various data-centric machine learning (ML) models in software-intensive systems has posed new challenges in the quality assurance practice of software engineering, especially in a high-risk environment. ML experts are now focusing on explaining ML models to assure the safe behavior of ML-based systems. However, not enough attention has been paid to explain the inherent uncertainty of the training data. The current practice of ML-based system engineering lacks transparency in the systematic fitness assessment process of the training data before engaging in the rigorous ML model training. We propose a method of assessing the collective confidence in the quality of a training dataset by using Dempster Shafer theory and its modified combination rule (Yager's rule). With the example of training datasets for pedestrian detection of autonomous vehicles, we demonstrate how the proposed approach can be used by the stakeholders with diverse expertise to combine their beliefs in the quality arguments and evidences about the data. Our results open up a scope of future research on data requirements engineering that can facilitate evidence-based data assurance for ML-based safety-critical systems.},

abstract = {The performance of neural code search is significantly influenced by the quality of the training data from which the neural models are derived. A large corpus of high-quality query and code pairs is demanded to establish a precise mapping from the natural language to the programming language. Due to the limited availability, most widely-used code search datasets are established with compromise, such as using code comments as a replacement of queries. Our empirical study on a famous code search dataset reveals that over one-third of its queries contain noises that make them deviate from natural user queries. Models trained through noisy data are faced with severe performance degradation when applied in real-world scenarios. To improve the dataset quality and make the queries of its samples semantically identical to real user queries is critical for the practical usability of neural code search. In this paper, we propose a data cleaning framework consisting of two subsequent filters: a rule-based syntactic filter and a model-based semantic filter. This is the first framework that applies semantic query cleaning to code search datasets. Experimentally, we evaluated the effectiveness of our framework on two widely-used code search models and three manually-annotated code retrieval benchmarks. Training the popular DeepCS model with the filtered dataset from our framework improves its performance by 19.2% MRR and 21.3% Answer@1, on average with the three validation benchmarks.},

abstract = {This work reveals that memory-intensive computation is a rising performance-critical factor in recent machine learning models. Due to a unique set of new challenges, existing ML optimizing compilers cannot perform efficient fusion under complex two-level dependencies combined with just-in-time demand. They face the dilemma of either performing costly fusion due to heavy redundant computation, or skipping fusion which results in massive number of kernels. Furthermore, they often suffer from low parallelism due to the lack of support for real-world production workloads with irregular tensor shapes. To address these rising challenges, we propose AStitch, a machine learning optimizing compiler that opens a new multi-dimensional optimization space for memory-intensive ML computations. It systematically abstracts four operator-stitching schemes while considering multi-dimensional optimization objectives, tackles complex computation graph dependencies with novel hierarchical data reuse, and efficiently processes various tensor shapes via adaptive thread mapping. Finally, AStitch provides just-in-time support incorporating our proposed optimizations for both ML training and inference. Although AStitch serves as a stand-alone compiler engine that is portable to any version of TensorFlow, its basic ideas can be generally applied to other ML frameworks and optimization compilers. Experimental results show that AStitch can achieve an average of 1.84x speedup (up to 2.73x) over the state-of-the-art Google's XLA solution across five production workloads. We also deploy AStitch onto a production cluster for ML workloads with thousands of GPUs. The system has been in operation for more than 10 months and saves about 20,000 GPU hours for 70,000 tasks per week.},

While many companies have developed the learning management systems (LMSs) for facilitating the online training of employees, a long-standing important issue is how to achieve personalized training recommendations with the consideration of their needs for future career development. To this end, in this paper, we propose an explainable personalized online course recommender system for enhancing employee training and development. A unique perspective of our system is to jointly model both the employees’ current competencies and their career development preferences in an explainable way. Specifically, the recommender system is based on a novel end-to-end hierarchical framework, namely Demand-aware Collaborative Bayesian Variational Network (DCBVN). In DCBVN, we first extract the latent interpretable representations of the employees’ competencies from their skill profiles with autoencoding variational inference based topic modeling. Then, we develop an effective demand recognition mechanism for learning the personal demands of career development for employees. In particular, all the above processes are integrated into a unified Bayesian inference view for obtaining both accurate and explainable recommendations. Finally, extensive experimental results on real-world data clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and the interpretability of DCBVN, as well as its robustness on sparse and cold-start scenarios.},

abstract = {Checkpointing and faithful replay are important for the training process of a Deep Learning (DL) model. It may improve productivity, model performance, robustness, and help security auditing. However, the inherent nondeterminism in training poses prominent challenges. Even with fixed random seeds, multiple runs of a same training pipeline may yield models whose performance varies by 20% percent. With existing infrastructural checkpointing support, developers cannot faithfully replay a training process. In this paper, we propose DETrain, a new solution to checkpointing and faithful execution/replay for long running DL training programs. We introduce a novel random number generation mechanism that can generate consistent random numbers in the presence of data parallelism. In addition, we devise a novel analysis that can determine a set of state variables that are necessary for faithful replay. These variables are either saved in a checkpoint or re-generated by fast forwarding, a selective execution technique. DETrain is evaluated on 13 PyTorch models and 16 Tensorflow models. It can deterministically execute these programs and replay from checkpoints with reasonable overhead. It also helps developers in diagnosing problems in training.},

abstract = {Training deep neural networks (DNNs) takes significant time and resources. A practice for expedited deployment is to use pre-trained deep neural networks (PTNNs), often from model zoos--collections of PTNNs; yet, the reliability of model zoos remains unexamined. In the absence of an industry standard for the implementation and performance of PTNNs, engineers cannot confidently incorporate them into production systems. As a first step, discovering potential discrepancies between PTNNs across model zoos would reveal a threat to model zoo reliability. Prior works indicated existing variances in deep learning systems in terms of accuracy. However, broader measures of reliability for PTNNs from model zoos are unexplored. This work measures notable discrepancies between accuracy, latency, and architecture of 36 PTNNs across four model zoos. Among the top 10 discrepancies, we find differences of 1.23%-2.62% in accuracy and 9%-131% in latency. We also find mismatches in architecture for well-known DNN architectures (e.g., ResNet and AlexNet). Our findings call for future works on empirical validation, automated tools for measurement, and best practices for implementation.},

abstract = {We introduce Smart Shuffling, a cross-lingual embedding (CLE) method that draws from statistical word alignment approaches to leverage dictionaries, producing dense representations that are significantly more effective for cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) than prior CLE methods. This work is motivated by the observation that although neural approaches are successful for monolingual IR, they are less effective in the cross-lingual setting. We hypothesize that neural CLIR fails because typical cross-lingual embeddings "translate" query terms into related terms -- i.e., terms that appear in a similar context -- in addition to or sometimes rather than synonyms in the target language. Adding related terms to a query (i.e., query expansion) can be valuable for retrieval, but must be mitigated by also focusing on the starting query. We find that prior neural CLIR models are unable to bridge the translation gap, apparently producing queries that drift from the intent of the source query.We conduct extrinsic evaluations of a range of CLE methods using CLIR performance, compare them to neural and statistical machine translation systems trained on the same translation data, and show a significant gap in effectiveness. Our experiments on standard CLIR collections across four languages indicate that Smart Shuffling fills the translation gap and provides significantly improved semantic matching quality. Having such a representation allows us to exploit deep neural (re-)ranking methods for the CLIR task, leading to substantial improvement with up to 21% gain in MAP, approaching human translation performance. Evaluations on bilingual lexicon induction show a comparable improvement.},

abstract = {Ranking has always been one of the top concerns in information retrieval researches. For decades, the lexical matching signal has dominated the ad-hoc retrieval process, but solely using this signal in retrieval may cause the vocabulary mismatch problem. In recent years, with the development of representation learning techniques, many researchers turn to Dense Retrieval (DR) models for better ranking performance. Although several existing DR models have already obtained promising results, their performance improvement heavily relies on the sampling of training examples. Many effective sampling strategies are not efficient enough for practical usage, and for most of them, there still lacks theoretical analysis in how and why performance improvement happens. To shed light on these research questions, we theoretically investigate different training strategies for DR models and try to explain why hard negative sampling performs better than random sampling. Through the analysis, we also find that there are many potential risks in static hard negative sampling, which is employed by many existing training methods. Therefore, we propose two training strategies named a Stable Training Algorithm for dense Retrieval (STAR) and a query-side training Algorithm for Directly Optimizing Ranking pErformance (ADORE), respectively. STAR improves the stability of DR training process by introducing random negatives. ADORE replaces the widely-adopted static hard negative sampling method with a dynamic one to directly optimize the ranking performance. Experimental results on two publicly available retrieval benchmark datasets show that either strategy gains significant improvements over existing competitive baselines and a combination of them leads to the best performance.},

abstract = {Dense retrieval has shown promising results in many information retrieval (IR) related tasks, whose foundation is high-quality text representation learning for effective search. Some recent studies have shown that autoencoder-based language models are able to boost the dense retrieval performance using a weak decoder. However, we argue that 1) it is not discriminative to decode all the input texts and, 2) even a weak decoder has the bypass effect on the encoder. Therefore, in this work, we introduce a novel contrastive span prediction task to pre-train the encoder alone, but still retain the bottleneck ability of the autoencoder. In this way, we can 1) learn discriminative text representations efficiently with the group-wise contrastive learning over spans and, 2) avoid the bypass effect of the decoder thoroughly. Comprehensive experiments over publicly available retrieval benchmark datasets show that our approach can outperform existing pre-training methods for dense retrieval significantly.},

abstract = {Code review is an essential part to software development lifecycle since it aims at guaranteeing the quality of codes. Modern code review activities necessitate developers viewing, understanding and even running the programs to assess logic, functionality, latency, style and other factors. It turns out that developers have to spend far too much time reviewing the code of their peers. Accordingly, it is in significant demand to automate the code review process. In this research, we focus on utilizing pre-training techniques for the tasks in the code review scenario. We collect a large-scale dataset of real-world code changes and code reviews from open-source projects in nine of the most popular programming languages. To better understand code diffs and reviews, we propose CodeReviewer, a pre-trained model that utilizes four pre-training tasks tailored specifically for the code review scenario. To evaluate our model, we focus on three key tasks related to code review activities, including code change quality estimation, review comment generation and code refinement. Furthermore, we establish a high-quality benchmark dataset based on our collected data for these three tasks and conduct comprehensive experiments on it. The experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art pre-training approaches in all tasks. Further analysis show that our proposed pre-training tasks and the multilingual pre-training dataset benefit the model on the understanding of code changes and reviews.},

Programmers routinely turn to online resources such as Stack Overflow for help, but understanding of debugging search practices, as well as tool support to find debugging resources, remains limited. Existing tools that mine online help forums are generally not aimed at novices, and programmers face varying levels of success when looking for online resources. Furthermore, training online code search skills is pedagogically challenging, as we have little understanding of how expertise impacts programmers' web search behavior while debugging code.We help fill these knowledge gaps with the results of a study of 40 programmers investigating differences in Stack Overflow search behavior at three levels of expertise: novices, experienced programmers who are novices in Python (the language we use in our study), and experienced Python programmers. We observe significant differences between all three levels in their ability to find posts helpful for debugging a given error, with both general and language-specific expertise facilitating Stack Overflow search efficacy and debugging success. We also conduct an exploratory investigation of factors that correlate with this difference, such as the display rank of the selected link and the number of links checked per search query. We conclude with an analysis of how online search behavior and results vary by Python error type. Our findings can inform online code search pedagogy, as well as inform the development of future automated tools.},

abstract = {Freelance translators today have at their disposal an ever-increasing array of online tools and language resources, including search engines, electronic mail, dictionaries, document archives, and terminology databases. A survey of working practices has been conducted among UK translators, with responses received to date from around 400 freelancers. Included in the survey was an investigation of the uptake of online services by translators, the findings of which are reported in this paper. These findings indicate that freelance translators have adopted, and are making extensive use of, both general online tools, and more specialised online terminology resources. Less use is being made, however, of mailing lists, document archives, and online machine translation. The paper concludes with a discussion of the findings, together with a number of research questions arising from those findings.},

abstract = {OCR errors hurt retrieval performance to a great extent. Research has been done on modelling and correction of OCR errors. However, most of the existing systems use language dependent resources or training texts for studying the nature of errors. Not much research has been reported on improving retrieval performance from erroneous text when no training data is available. We propose a novel algorithm for detecting OCR errors and improving retrieval performance on an E-Discovery corpus. Our contribution is two-fold : (1) identifying erroneous variants of query terms for improvement in retrieval performance, and (2) presenting a scope for a possible error-modelling in the erroneous corpus where clean ground truth text is not available for comparison. Our algorithm does not use any training data or any language specific resources like thesaurus. It also does not use any knowledge about the language except that the word delimiter is blank space. The proposed approach obtained statistically significant improvements in recall over state-of-the-art baselines.},

abstract = {Source code representation learning is the basis of applying artificial intelligence to many software engineering tasks such as code clone detection, algorithm classification, and code summarization. Recently, many works have tried to improve the performance of source code representation from various perspectives, e.g., introducing the structural information of programs into latent representation. However, when dealing with rapidly expanded unlabeled cross-language source code datasets from the Internet, there are still two issues. Firstly, deep learning models for many code-specific tasks still suffer from the lack of high-quality labels. Secondly, the structural differences among programming languages make it more difficult to process multiple languages in a single neural architecture.To address these issues, in this article, we propose a novel Cross-language Code representation with a large-scale pre-training (XCode) method. Concretely, we propose to use several abstract syntax trees and ELMo-enhanced variational autoencoders to obtain multiple pre-trained source code language models trained on about 1.5 million code snippets. To fully utilize the knowledge across programming languages, we further propose a Shared Encoder-Decoder (SED) architecture which uses the multi-teacher single-student method to transfer knowledge from the aforementioned pre-trained models to the distilled SED. The pre-trained models and SED will cooperate to better represent the source code. For evaluation, we examine our approach on three typical downstream cross-language tasks, i.e., source code translation, code clone detection, and code-to-code search, on a real-world dataset composed of programming exercises with multiple solutions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach on cross-language code representations. Meanwhile, our approach performs significantly better than several code representation baselines on different downstream tasks in terms of multiple automatic evaluation metrics.},

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed a persistent interest in generating pseudo test collections, both for training and evaluation purposes. We describe a method for generating queries and relevance judgments for microblog search in an unsupervised way. Our starting point is this intuition: tweets with a hashtag are relevant to the topic covered by the hashtag and hence to a suitable query derived from the hashtag. Our baseline method selects all commonly used hashtags, and all associated tweets as relevance judgments; we then generate a query from these tweets. Next, we generate a timestamp for each query, allowing us to use temporal information in the training process. We then enrich the generation process with knowledge derived from an editorial test collection for microblog search.We use our pseudo test collections in two ways. First, we tune parameters of a variety of well known retrieval methods on them. Correlations with parameter sweeps on an editorial test collection are high on average, with a large variance over retrieval algorithms. Second, we use the pseudo test collections as training sets in a learning to rank scenario. Performance close to training on an editorial test collection is achieved in many cases. Our results demonstrate the utility of tuning and training microblog search algorithms on automatically generated training material.},

abstract = {Mathematical formulas are an important tool to concisely communicate ideas in science and education, used to clarify descriptions, calculations or derivations. When searching in scientific literature, mathematical notation, which is often written using the LATEX notation, therefore plays a crucial role that should not be neglected. The task of mathematics-aware information retrieval is to retrieve relevant passages given a query or question, which both can include natural language and mathematical formulas. As in many domains that rely on Natural Language Understanding, transformer-based models are now dominating the field of information retrieval [3]. Apart from their size and the transformerencoder architecture, pre-training is considered to be a key factor for the high performance of these models. It has also been shown that domain-adaptive pre-training improves their performance on down-stream tasks even further [2] especially when the vocabulary overlap between pre-training and in-domain data is low. This is also the case for the domain of mathematical documents.},

abstract = {Multi-modal program synthesis refers to the task of synthesizing programs (code) from their specification given in different forms, such as a combination of natural language and examples. Examples provide a precise but incomplete specification, and natural language provides an ambiguous but more "complete" task description. Machine-learned pre-trained models (PTMs) are adept at handling ambiguous natural language, but struggle with generating syntactically and semantically precise code. Program synthesis techniques can generate correct code, often even from incomplete but precise specifications, such as examples, but they are unable to work with the ambiguity of natural languages. We present an approach that combines PTMs with component-based synthesis (CBS): PTMs are used to generate candidates programs from the natural language description of the task, which are then used to guide the CBS procedure to find the program that matches the precise examples-based specification. We use our combination approach to instantiate multi-modal synthesis systems for two programming domains: the domain of regular expressions and the domain of CSS selectors. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our domain-agnostic approach in comparison to a state-of-the-art specialized system, and the generality of our approach in providing multi-modal program synthesis from natural language and examples in different programming domains.},

abstract = {Automatic program understanding and generation techniques could significantly advance the productivity of programmers and have been widely studied by academia and industry. Recently, the advent of pre-trained paradigm enlightens researchers to develop general-purpose pre-trained models which can be applied for a broad range of program understanding and generation tasks. Such pre-trained models, derived by self-supervised objectives on large unlabelled corpora, can be fine-tuned in downstream tasks (such as code search and code generation) with minimal adaptations. Although these pre-trained models claim superiority over the prior techniques, they seldom follow equivalent evaluation protocols, e.g., they are hardly evaluated on the identical benchmarks, tasks, or settings. Consequently, there is a pressing need for a comprehensive study of the pre-trained models on their effectiveness, versatility as well as the limitations to provide implications and guidance for the future development in this area. To this end, we first perform an extensive study of eight open-access pre-trained models over a large benchmark on seven representative code tasks to assess their reproducibility. We further compare the pre-trained models and domain-specific state-of-the-art techniques for validating pre-trained effectiveness. At last, we investigate the robustness of the pre-trained models by inspecting their performance variations under adversarial attacks. Through the study, we find that while we can in general replicate the original performance of the pre-trained models on their evaluated tasks and adopted benchmarks, subtle performance fluctuations can refute the findings in their original papers. Moreover, none of the existing pre-trained models can dominate over all other models. We also find that the pre-trained models can significantly outperform non-pre-trained state-of-the-art techniques in program understanding tasks. Furthermore, we perform the first study for natural language-programming language pre-trained model robustness via adversarial attacks and find that a simple random attack approach can easily fool the state-of-the-art pre-trained models and thus incur security issues. At last, we also provide multiple practical guidelines for advancing future research on pre-trained models for program understanding and generation.},

abstract = {Can a machine find and fix a Semantic Bug? A Semantic Bug is a deviation from the expected program behaviour that causes to produce incorrect outputs for certain inputs. To identify this category of bugs, the knowledge on the expected program behaviour is essential. The reason is that a program with a semantic bug does not fail (i.e., crash or hang) in the middle of the execution in most scenarios. Thus, only a human (a user or a developer) knowing the correct program behaviour can detect this kind of bug by observing the output. However, identifying bugs solely through human effort is not practical for all software. A Test Oracle is any procedure used to differentiate the correct and incorrect behaviours of a program. This dissertation mainly focuses on developing learning techniques to produce Automated Test Oracles for programs with semantic bugs. Also, discovering methods to incorporate human knowledge effectively for the learning techniques is another concern. The automated test oracles could make semantic bug detection more efficient. Also, such test oracles could guide Automated Program Repair tools to generate more accurate fixes for semantic bugs.},

abstract = {How do we analyze sentiments over a set of opinionated Twitter messages? This issue has been widely studied in recent years, with a prominent approach being based on the application of classification techniques. Basically, messages are classified according to the implicit attitude of the writer with respect to a query term. A major concern, however, is that Twitter (and other media channels) follows the data stream model, and thus the classifier must operate with limited resources, including labeled data for training classification models. This imposes serious challenges for current classification techniques, since they need to be constantly fed with fresh training messages, in order to track sentiment drift and to provide up-to-date sentiment analysis.We propose solutions to this problem. The heart of our approach is a training augmentation procedure which takes as input a small training seed, and then it automatically incorporates new relevant messages to the training data. Classification models are produced on-the-fly using association rules, which are kept up-to-date in an incremental fashion, so that at any given time the model properly reflects the sentiments in the event being analyzed. In order to track sentiment drift, training messages are projected on a demand driven basis, according to the content of the message being classified. Projecting the training data offers a series of advantages, including the ability to quickly detect trending information emerging in the stream. We performed the analysis of major events in 2010, and we show that the prediction performance remains about the same, or even increases, as the stream passes and new training messages are acquired. This result holds for different languages, even in cases where sentiment distribution changes over time, or in cases where the initial training seed is rather small. We derive lower-bounds for prediction performance, and we show that our approach is extremely effective under diverse learning scenarios, providing gains that range from 7% to 58%.},

Our empirical analysis of CodeBERT's attention reveals that CodeBERT pays more attention to certain types of tokens and statements such as keywords and data-relevant statements. Based on these findings, we propose DietCode, which aims at lightweight leverage of large pre-trained models for source code. DietCode simplifies the input program of CodeBERT with three strategies, namely, word dropout, frequency filtering, and an attention-based strategy that selects statements and tokens that receive the most attention weights during pre-training. Hence, it gives a substantial reduction in the computational cost without hampering the model performance. Experimental results on two downstream tasks show that DietCode provides comparable results to CodeBERT with 40% less computational cost in fine-tuning and testing.},

We simulate evaluation incompleteness by sampling from the relevance assessments. Through large-scale experiments on two standard TREC test collections, we examine retrieval sensitivity when training - i.e. if a training process, based on any of the four discussed measures has an impact on the final retrieval performance. Experimental results show that training by bpref, infAP and nDCG provides significantly better retrieval performance than training by MAP when relevance judgements completeness is extremely low. When relevance judgements completeness increases, the measures behave more similarly.},

abstract = {Passage re-ranking is to obtain a permutation over the candidate passage set from retrieval stage. Re-rankers have been boomed by Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) due to their overwhelming advantages in natural language understanding. However, existing PLM based re-rankers may easily suffer from vocabulary mismatch and lack of domain specific knowledge. To alleviate these problems, explicit knowledge contained in knowledge graph is carefully introduced in our work. Specifically, we employ the existing knowledge graph which is incomplete and noisy, and first apply it in passage re-ranking task. To leverage a reliable knowledge, we propose a novel knowledge graph distillation method and obtain a knowledge meta graph as the bridge between query and passage. To align both kinds of embedding in the latent space, we employ PLM as text encoder and graph neural network over knowledge meta graph as knowledge encoder. Besides, a novel knowledge injector is designed for the dynamic interaction between text and knowledge encoder. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method especially in queries requiring in-depth domain knowledge.},

abstract = {Given a text/image query, image-text retrieval aims to find the relevant items in the database. Recently, visual-linguistic pre-training (VLP) methods have demonstrated promising accuracy on image-text retrieval and other visual-linguistic tasks. These VLP methods are typically pre-trained on a large amount of image-text pairs, then fine-tuned on various downstream tasks. Nevertheless, due to the natural modality incompleteness in image-text retrieval, i.e., the query is either image or text rather than an image-text pair, the naive application of VLP to image-text retrieval results in significant inefficiency. Moreover, existing VLP methods cannot extract comparable representations for a single-modal query and multi-modal database items. In this work, we propose a generative visual-linguistic pre-training approach, termed as GilBERT, to simultaneously learn generic representations of image-text data and complete the missing modality for incomplete pairs. In testing phase, the proposed GilBERT facilitates efficient vector-based retrieval by providing unified feature embedding for query and database items. Moreover, the generative training not only makes GilBERT compatible with non-parallel text/image corpus, but also enables GilBERT to model the image-text relationships without suffering massive randomly-sampled negative samples, leading to superior experimental performances. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of GilBERT in image-text retrieval, in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.},

abstract = {In precision-oriented tasks like answer ranking, it is more important to rank many relevant answers highly than to retrieve all relevant answers. It follows that a good ranking strategy would be to learn how to identify the easiest correct answers first (i.e., assign a high ranking score to answers that have characteristics that usually indicate relevance, and a low ranking score to those with characteristics that do not), before incorporating more complex logic to handle difficult cases (e.g., semantic matching or reasoning). In this work, we apply this idea to the training of neural answer rankers using curriculum learning. We propose several heuristics to estimate the difficulty of a given training sample. We show that the proposed heuristics can be used to build a training curriculum that down-weights difficult samples early in the training process. As the training process progresses, our approach gradually shifts to weighting all samples equally, regardless of difficulty. We present a comprehensive evaluation of our proposed idea on three answer ranking datasets. Results show that our approach leads to superior performance of two leading neural ranking architectures, namely BERT and ConvKNRM, using both pointwise and pairwise losses. When applied to a BERT-based ranker, our method yields up to a 4% improvement in MRR and a 9% improvement in P@1 (compared to the model trained without a curriculum). This results in models that can achieve comparable performance to more expensive state-of-the-art techniques.},

abstract = {Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) share many commonalities, including an agent who learns while interacts, a long-term and complex goal, and an algorithm that explores and adapts. To successfully apply RL methods to IIR, one challenge is to obtain sufficient relevance labels to train the RL agents, which are infamously known as sample inefficient. However, in a text corpus annotated for a given query, it is not the relevant documents but the irrelevant documents that predominate. This would cause very unbalanced training experiences for the agent and prevent it from learning any policy that is effective. Our paper addresses this issue by using domain randomization to synthesize more relevant documents for the training. Our experimental results on the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) Dynamic Domain (DD) 2017 Track show that the proposed method is able to boost an RL agent's learning effectiveness by 22% in dealing with unseen situations.},

abstract = {Novices' functionally-correct code is often redundant, verbose, or un-idiomatic. Such code could indicate shallow understanding of the programming language, or unfamiliarity with experts' preferences for code structure. Understanding why novices write poorly is important for designing instruction and tools to help novices write elegantly. 231 novices judged style and readability for sets of code snippets targeting seven topics. Within each set, functionality was the same, but the writing followed either common novice patterns or a more elegant, "expert" pattern. Overall, 76% of novices thought the "expert" snippets had the best style, but only 64% said those snippets were most readable. However, comprehension was similar for both "expert" and novice patterns, regardless of readability preferences. This suggests that students who prefer novice patterns do not necessarily have deep misunderstandings about the programming language. One topic included a code-writing task, and students' readability preferences were predictive of their code-writing patterns, suggesting that readability preferences reflect writing choices rather than comprehension. Thus, novices may benefit from lightweight tools that identify common patterns and suggest an "expert" solution, while helping them see that the "expert" solution is more readable than they think.},

Experts who work successfully within this collaborative domain could offer insight into the considerations and process they use to more effectively capture this cobot capability. Using an analysis of expert insights in the collaborative interaction design space, we developed a set of Expert Frames based on these insights and integrated these Expert Frames into a new training and programming system that can be used to teach novice operators to think, program, and troubleshoot in ways that experts do. We present our system and case studies that demonstrate how Expert Frames provide novice users with the ability to analyze and learn from complex cobot application scenarios.},

Currently available systems for this purpose are limited to monitoring only the logged data that must be specified before the training process starts. Each time a new information is desired, a cycle of stop-change-restart is required in the training process. These limitations make interactive exploration and diagnosis tasks difficult, imposing long tedious iterations during the model development. We present a new system that enables users to perform interactive queries on live processes generating real-time information that can be rendered in multiple formats on multiple surfaces in the form of several desired visualizations simultaneously. To achieve this, we model various exploratory inspection and diagnostic tasks for deep learning training processes as specifications for streams using a map-reduce paradigm with which many data scientists are already familiar. Our design achieves generality and extensibility by defining composable primitives which is a fundamentally different approach than is used by currently available systems.},

abstract = {Recently, pre-training methods tailored for IR tasks have achieved great success. However, as the mechanisms behind the performance improvement remain under-investigated, the interpretability and robustness of these pre-trained models still need to be improved. Axiomatic IR aims to identify a set of desirable properties expressed mathematically as formal constraints to guide the design of ranking models. Existing studies have already shown that considering certain axioms may help improve the effectiveness and interpretability of IR models. However, there still lack efforts of incorporating these IR axioms into pre-training methodologies. To shed light on this research question, we propose a novel pre-training method with underlineA xiomatic underlineRe gularization for ad hoc underlineS earch (ARES). In the ARES framework, a number of existing IR axioms are re-organized to generate training samples to be fitted in the pre-training process. These training samples then guide neural rankers to learn the desirable ranking properties. Compared to existing pre-training approaches, ARES is more intuitive and explainable. Experimental results on multiple publicly available benchmark datasets have shown the effectiveness of ARES in both full-resource and low-resource (e.g., zero-shot and few-shot) settings. An intuitive case study also indicates that ARES has learned useful knowledge that existing pre-trained models (e.g., BERT and PROP) fail to possess. This work provides insights into improving the interpretability of pre-trained models and the guidance of incorporating IR axioms or human heuristics into pre-training methods.},

abstract = {Recently, pre-training methods have shown remarkable success in task-oriented dialog (TOD) systems. However, most existing pre-trained models for TOD focus on either dialog understanding or dialog generation, but not both. In this paper, we propose SPACE, a novel unified pre-trained dialog model learning from large-scale dialog corpora with limited annotations, which can be effectively fine-tuned on a wide range of downstream dialog tasks. Specifically, SPACE consists of four successive components in a single transformer to maintain a task-flow in TOD systems: (i) a dialog encoding module to encode dialog history, (ii) a dialog understanding module to extract semantic vectors from either user queries or system responses, (iii) a dialog policy module to generate a policy vector that contains high-level semantics of the response, and (iv) a dialog generation module to produce appropriate responses. We design a dedicated pre-training objective for each component. Concretely, we pre-train the dialog encoding module with span mask language modeling to learn contextualized dialog information. To capture the structured dialog semantics, we pre-train the dialog understanding module via a novel tree-induced semi-supervised contrastive learning objective with the help of extra dialog annotations. In addition, we pre-train the dialog policy module by minimizing the ℒ2 distance between its output policy vector and the semantic vector of the response for policy optimization. Finally, the dialog generation model is pre-trained by language modeling. Results show that SPACE achieves state-of-the-art performance on eight downstream dialog benchmarks, including intent prediction, dialog state tracking, and end-to-end dialog modeling. We also show that SPACE has a stronger few-shot ability than existing models under the low-resource setting.},

abstract = {The two-tower architecture has been widely applied for learning item and user representations, which is important for large-scale recommender systems. Many two-tower models are trained using various in-batch negative sampling strategies, where the effects of such strategies inherently rely on the size of mini-batches. However, training two-tower models with a large batch size is inefficient, as it demands a large volume of memory for item and user contents and consumes a lot of time for feature encoding. Interestingly, we find that neural encoders can output relatively stable features for the same input after warming up in the training process. Based on such facts, we propose a simple yet effective sampling strategy called Cross-Batch Negative Sampling (CBNS), which takes advantage of the encoded item embeddings from recent mini-batches to boost the model training. Both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of CBNS.},

abstract = {It is well accepted that using high-dimensional multi-modal visual features for image content representation and classifier training may achieve more sufficient characterization of the diverse visual properties of the images and further result in higher discrimination power of the classifiers. However, training the classifiers in a high-dimensional multi-modal feature space requires a large number of labeled training images, which will further result in the problem of curse of dimensionality. To tackle this problem, a hierarchical feature subset selection algorithm is proposed to enable more accurate image classification, where the processes for feature selection and classifier training are seamlessly integrated in a single framework. First, a feature hierarchy (i.e., concept tree for automatic feature space partition and organization) is used to automatically partition high-dimensional heterogeneous multi-modal visual features into multiple low-dimensional homogeneous single-modal feature subsets according to their certain physical meanings and each of them is used to characterize one certain type of the diverse visual properties of the images. Second, principal component analysis (PCA) is performed on each homogeneous singlemodal feature subset to select the most representative feature dimensions and a weak classifier is learned simultaneously. After the weak classifiers and their representative feature dimensions are available for all these homogeneous single-modal feature subsets, they are combined to generate an ensemble image classifier and achieve hierarchical feature subset selection. Our experiments on a specific domain of natural images have also obtained very positive results.},

abstract = {Computer defense is not perfect. Each year hackers exploit hundreds of vulnerabilities in information systems even though millions of dollars are spent on information security. Firewalls, intrusion detection systems and patch management software all help to increase systems security, but they are only perimeter defenses. Once inside, a hacker can do significant damage and the vulnerability to deception is great. At that point, users become the last line of defense. This paper describes two field studies in which scenario-based training was used to teach information systems users how detect deception in the information they use. The first study provided deception detection training to human resource specialists who queried a database to get the need information to make decision about personnel in their organization. Deceptive data was planted in the database. The second provided training to communications specialists using a computer based training systems called Agent99. In both studies scenarios were developed as a foundation of the training programs provided. The use of the scenarios helped to keep the participants involved and focused on the training. More importantly, the subjects who received the scenario based training curriculum improved their knowledge of deception and their ability to detect deceptive data in information systems.},

abstract = {Learning to understand user search intents from their online behaviors is crucial for both Web search and online advertising. However, it is a challenging task to collect and label a sufficient amount of high quality training data for various user intents such as "compare products", "plan a travel", etc. Motivated by this bottleneck, we start with some user common sense, i.e. a set of rules, to generate training data for learning to predict user intents. The rule-generated training data are however hard to be used since these data are generally imperfect due to the serious data bias and possible data noises. In this paper, we introduce a Co-learning Framework (CLF) to tackle the problem of learning from biased and noisy rule-generated training data. CLF firstly generates multiple sets of possibly biased and noisy training data using different rules, and then trains the individual user search intent classifiers over different training datasets independently. The intermediate classifiers are then used to categorize the training data themselves as well as the unlabeled data. The confidently classified data by one classifier are added to other training datasets and the incorrectly classified ones are instead filtered out from the training datasets. The algorithmic performance of this iterative learning procedure is theoretically guaranteed.},

abstract = {Previous entity linking methods in knowledge graphs (KGs) mostly link the textual mentions to corresponding entities. However, they have deficiencies in processing numerous multimodal data, when the text is too short to provide enough context. Consequently, we conceive the idea of introducing valuable information of other modalities, and propose a novel multimodal entity linking method with gated hierarchical multimodal fusion and contrastive training (GHMFC). Firstly, in order to discover the fine-grained inter-modal correlations, GHMFC extracts the hierarchical features of text and visual co-attention through the multi-modal co-attention mechanism: textual-guided visual attention and visual-guided textual attention. The former attention obtains weighted visual features under the guidance of textual information. In contrast, the latter attention produces weighted textual features under the guidance of visual information. Afterwards, gated fusion is used to evaluate the importance of hierarchical features of different modalities and integrate them into the final multimodal representations of mentions. Subsequently, contrastive training with two types of contrastive losses is designed to learn more generic multimodal features and reduce noise. Finally, the linking entities are selected by calculating the cosine similarity between representations of mentions and entities in KGs. To evaluate the proposed method, this paper releases two new open multimodal entity linking datasets: WikiMEL and Richpedia-MEL. Experimental results demonstrate that GHMFC can learn meaningful multimodal representation and significantly outperforms most of the baseline methods.},

abstract = {The ability to learn programs from few examples is a powerful technology with disruptive applications in many domains, as it allows users to automate repetitive tasks in an intuitive way. Existing frameworks on inductive synthesis only perform syntactic manipulations, where they rely on the syntactic structure of the given examples and not their meaning. Any semantic manipulations, such as transforming dates, have to be manually encoded by the designer of the inductive programming framework. Recent advances in large language models have shown these models to be very adept at performing semantic transformations of its input by simply providing a few examples of the task at hand. When it comes to syntactic transformations, however, these models are limited in their expressive power. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for integrating inductive synthesis with few-shot learning language models to combine the strength of these two popular technologies. In particular, the inductive synthesis is tasked with breaking down the problem in smaller subproblems, among which those that cannot be solved syntactically are passed to the language model. We formalize three semantic operators that can be integrated with inductive synthesizers. To minimize invoking expensive semantic operators during learning, we introduce a novel deferred query execution algorithm that considers the operators to be oracles during learning. We evaluate our approach in the domain of string transformations: the combination methodology can automate tasks that cannot be handled using either technologies by themselves. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of our approach via a case study in the domain of string profiling.},

DES introduces fully synchronous training to large-scale recommendation system for the first time by reducing communication, thus making the training of commercial recommender systems converge faster and reach better CTR. DES requires much less communication by substituting the weights-rich operators with the computationally equivalent sub-operators and aggregating partial results instead of transmitting the huge sparse weights directly through the network. Due to the use of synchronous training on large-scale Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs), DES achieves higher AUC(Area Under ROC). We successfully apply DES training on multiple popular DLRMs of industrial scenarios. Experiments show that our implementation outperforms the state-of-the-art PS-based training framework, achieving up to 68.7% communication savings and higher throughput compared to other PS-based recommender systems.},

abstract = {Biomedical text mining is becoming increasingly important. Recently, biomedical pre-trained language models such as BioBERT and SciBERT, which can capture biomedical knowledge from text, have achieved promising results in biomedical NLP tasks. However, most biomedical pre-trained language models rely on the traditional masked language model (MLM) pre-training strategy, which cannot fully capture the semantic relations of context. It is challenging to learn biomedical knowledge via language models in the Chinese biomedical fields due to the lack of training resources and the extreme complexity and diversity of Chinese medical terminologies. To this end, we propose MedBERT-adv, which utilizes a biomedical knowledge infusion method that can effectively complement BERT-like models. Instead of using time-consuming medical expert annotation and inaccurate automatic annotation, we use the article structure in Baidu Encyclopedia as a weakly supervised signal, utilizing each medical term and its category as labels to pre-train the model. We also leverage adversarial training strategies like FGM for fine-tuning downstream tasks to further improve the performance of MedBERT-adv. We experimented with MedBERT-adv on the Chinese biomedical dataset CBLUE using eight NLP tasks. Among all of them, our proposed model obtained an average 1.8% improvement in average score than four baseline models, demonstrating the effectiveness of MedBERT-adv on Chinese biomedical text mining.},

abstract = {While implicit feedback (e.g., clicks, dwell times, etc.) is an abundant and attractive source of data for learning to rank, it can produce unfair ranking policies for both exogenous and endogenous reasons. Exogenous reasons typically manifest themselves as biases in the training data, which then get reflected in the learned ranking policy and often lead to rich-get-richer dynamics. Moreover, even after the correction of such biases, reasons endogenous to the design of the learning algorithm can still lead to ranking policies that do not allocate exposure among items in a fair way. To address both exogenous and endogenous sources of unfairness, we present the first learning-to-rank approach that addresses both presentation bias and merit-based fairness of exposure simultaneously. Specifically, we define a class of amortized fairness-of-exposure constraints that can be chosen based on the needs of an application, and we show how these fairness criteria can be enforced despite the selection biases in implicit feedback data. The key result is an efficient and flexible policy-gradient algorithm, called FULTR, which is the first to enable the use of counterfactual estimators for both utility estimation and fairness constraints. Beyond the theoretical justification of the framework, we show empirically that the proposed algorithm can learn accurate and fair ranking policies from biased and noisy feedback.},

The evaluation model assumes a bilingual user who has found documents on a topic and identified a few passages in each language on aspects of that topic. Additional passages are then automatically labeled using a k-Nearest-Neighbor classifier and local (i.e., result set) Latent Semantic Analysis. Experiments show that when few training examples are available in either language, classification using training examples from both languages can often achieve higher effectiveness than using training examples from just one language. When the total number of training examples is held constant, classification effectiveness correlates positively with the fraction of same-language training examples in the training set. These results suggest that supervised classification can benefit from hand-annotating a few same-language examples, and that when performing classification in bilingual collections it is useful to label some examples in each language.},

It is costly to annotate training data for different search domains and tasks. We propose to exploit training data annotated for a related domain to learn to rank retrieved documents in the target domain, in which no labeled data is available. We present a simple yet effective approach based on instance-weighting scheme. Our method first estimates the importance of each related-domain document relative to the target domain. Then heuristics are studied to transform the importance of individual documents to the pairwise weights of document pairs, which can be directly incorporated into the popular ranking algorithms. Due to importance weighting, ranking model trained on related domain is highly adaptable to the data of target domain. Ranking adaptation experiments on LETOR3.0 dataset [27] demonstrate that with a fair amount of related-domain training data, our method significantly outperforms the baseline without weighting, and most of time is not significantly worse than an "ideal" model directly trained on target domain.},

Although "learning by doing" is widely advocated to address this topic's abstract and fuzzy nature, educators are still facing various difficulties in practice, especially including students' vicious circle of inexperience and the mental model dilemma in experiential learning.Aims: To help break the aforementioned vicious circle and mental model dilemma, this work aims to investigate our educational strategy of using lightweight projects with public and free PaaS resources (1) to help students accumulate architectural experience from the early stage and (2) to facilitate strengthening students' fundamental architecture knowledge.Method: To collect more empirical evidence, we conducted action research on our educational strategy across three undergraduate-curriculum courses for two years. In particular, we employed the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to validate how well students received such an educational strategy.Results: The students involved in the relevant coursework generally gave positive feedback with respect to learning theoretical concepts and a set of architectural patterns. Meanwhile, we also observed diverse learning curves for utilizing PaaS resources.Conclusions: Although there still exist PaaS-related limits, our educational strategy can foster students' experiential learning and collaborative learning in fundamental architecture courses. We believe that there are also potentials to extend our work to broader and advanced courses of software architecture.},

To mitigate this limitation, we introduce a supervised RoBERTa QA method that is trained to mimic the behavior of BM25 and the soft-matching idea behind embedding-based alignment methods. We show that fusing the simple lexical-matching IR concepts in transformer techniques results in improvement a) of their (lexical-matching) interpretability, b) retrieval performance, and c) the QA performance on two multi-hop QA datasets.

Most defense techniques are tailored to specific semantic level attacks and do not possess the ability to mitigate multi-level attack simultaneously. Adversarial training has been shown the effectiveness of increasing model robustness. However, it often suffers from degradation on normal data, especially when the proportion of adversarial examples increase. To address this, we propose mixup regularized adversarial training (MRAT) against multi-level attack. Our method can utilize multiple adversarial examples to increase model intrinsic robustness without sacrificing the performance on normal data. We evaluate our method on text classification and entailment tasks. Experimental results on different text encoders (BERT, LSTM and CNN) with multi-level attack show that our method outperforms adversarial training consistently.},

This paper extends the passage ordering task from sentences to paragraphs, i.e., passages with multiple sentences. Increasing the passage length increases the task's difficulty.

We empirically evaluate the proposed models for sentence and paragraph ordering. Our best model outperforms previous state of the art methods by 0.057 Kendall's Tau on one of three sentence ordering benchmarks (arXiv, VIST, ROC-Story). For paragraph ordering, we construct two novel datasets from Wikipedia and CNN-DailyMail on which we achieve 0.67 and 0.47 Kendall's Tau. The best model variation utilises multiple pointer networks in an ensemble-like fashion. We hypothesise that the use of multiple pointers better reflects the multitude of possible orders of paragraphs in more complex texts. Our code, data, and models are publicly available1.},

abstract = {Programming is central to Computer Science and cognate disciplines, and poses early-learning challenges in problem-solving and coding. Since the recent past the School of Computer Science &amp; Information Technology (RMIT University) has provided a student mentoring service to assist novice student programmers with their programming, indeed, to build up their confidence in programming. The service has received favourable feedback from students and, as an interesting aside, has had the added benefit of increasing mentors' confidence and improving mentors' communication skills. Mentors volunteer their services under a University leadership initiative, and are not paid to assist students. In light of such success, we secured a University action-research teaching and learning grant, to investigate aspects of the service delivered to date. While mentoring has been shown to be helpful for novice student programmers to learn and improve their programming, less recognised, but of equal importance, is the value to mentors through the skills and experience they gain. This paper reports early findings of a dual-purpose research investigation into the mentoring service. The research project seeks to discover ways to improve the mentoring service for novice student programmers, as well as to enhance a range of qualities in mentors.},

abstract = {Lack of security expertise among software practitioners is a problem with many implications. First, there is a deficit of security professionals to meet current needs. Additionally, even practitioners who do not plan to work in security may benefit from increased understanding of security. The goal of this paper is to aid software engineering educators in designing a comprehensive software security course by sharing an experience running a software security course for the eleventh time. Through all the eleven years of running the software security course, the course objectives have been comprehensive - ranging from security testing, to secure design and coding, to security requirements to security risk management. For the first time in this eleventh year, a theme of the course assignments was to map vulnerability discovery to the security controls of the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS). Based upon student performance on a final exploratory penetration testing project, this mapping may have increased students' depth of understanding of a wider range of security topics. The students efficiently detected 191 unique and verified vulnerabilities of 28 different Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) types during a three-hour period in the OpenMRS project, an electronic health record application in active use.},

abstract = {Sequential Recommendation characterizes the evolving patterns by modeling item sequences chronologically. The essential target of it is to capture the item transition correlations. The recent developments of transformer inspire the community to design effective sequence encoders,e.g., SASRec and BERT4Rec. However, we observe that these transformer-based models suffer from the cold-start issue,i.e., performing poorly for short sequences. Therefore, we propose to augment short sequences while still preserving original sequential correlations. We introduce a new framework for Augmenting Sequential Recommendation with Pseudo-prior items (ASReP). We firstly pre-train a transformer with sequences in a reverse direction to predict prior items. Then, we use this transformer to generate fabricated historical items at the beginning of short sequences. Finally, we fine-tune the transformer using these augmented sequences from the time order to predict the next item. Experiments on two real-world datasets verify the effectiveness of ASReP. The code is available on https://github.com/DyGRec/ASReP.},

abstract = {A recent study by Ahmed and Devanbu reported that using a corpus of code written in multilingual datasets to fine-tune multilingual Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) achieves higher performance as opposed to using a corpus of code written in just one programming language. However, no analysis was made with respect to fine-tuning monolingual PLMs. Furthermore, some programming languages are inherently different and code written in one language usually cannot be interchanged with the others, i.e., Ruby and Java code possess very different structure. To better understand how monolingual and multilingual PLMs affect different programming languages, we investigate 1) the performance of PLMs on Ruby for two popular Software Engineering tasks: Code Summarization and Code Search, 2) the strategy (to select programming languages) that works well on fine-tuning multilingual PLMs for Ruby, and 3) the performance of the fine-tuned PLMs on Ruby given different code lengths.In this work, we analyze over a hundred of pre-trained and fine-tuned models. Our results show that 1) multilingual PLMs have a lower Performance-to-Time Ratio (the BLEU, METEOR, or MRR scores over the fine-tuning duration) as compared to monolingual PLMs, 2) our proposed strategy to select target programming languages to fine-tune multilingual PLMs is effective --- it reduces the time to fine-tune yet achieves higher performance in Code Summarization and Code Search tasks, and 3) our proposed strategy consistently shows good performance on different code lengths.},

We propose an approach based on data-mining techniques to automatically obtain frequent software-related discussions from the developer's IM logs, extracting what we call the Project's Frequent Knowledge (PFK). We assessed the proposed approach evaluating three newcomers' knowledge acquisition regarding a software project. The results demonstrated that, on average, 70% of the frequent software-related discussions identified in this study were useful to determine the PFK, and newcomers were able to comprehend software related issues by analyzing the PFK. Our findings indicate the usefulness of the proposed approach to extract software knowledge from developers' IM logs and support newcomers' onboarding. Moreover, a conducted follow-up interview involving newcomers and the team's project manager revealed the feasibility of using PFK on knowledge transfer and acquisition.},

On the other hand, the skills in SE-related fields have been changing significantly for the past decade, which requires more frequent updates to the curriculum and teaching materials. There is a strong demand for a better course guide and recommendation system to aid higher education in SE to keep up with the industry requirements. In this work, we incorporate data mining techniques, a natural language processing model, and a recommendation system in a web application that helps SE students and university faculty with those challenges. Our proposed hybrid Course Recommendation System (CRS) consists of two web applications (user and admin web apps) to provide multiple features, including user-specific suggestions for university courses, careers, jobs, industry-demanded skills together with online materials to learn those skills, and various analysis dashboards for both SE students and lecturers. We conduct a survey on SE students and faculty members to evaluate the initial impact of our CRS on the end users, which proved the effectiveness of our approach in addressing the mentioned issues.

abstract = {Online learning (also known as e-learning) will ultimately become the new training paradigm, taking its place alongside traditional contact situation training and changing the face of training generally. A number of trends, which include technological developments and the growth of the Internet, have accelerated the move to e-learning in educational institutions and the corporate world. Technology and the Internet facilitate a more active role in the training process. There is a gap in the literature as to which online tools and learning strategies are suitable for human resources development in the corporate training environment. The aim of this paper is to identify and discuss e-learning strategies and tools for human resources development in the corporate training environment in South Africa. The study may provide important insights into the future integration of online learning by South African companies, human resources development managers and policy formulators. This research was based on a qualitative research approach where individual interviews, focus group interviews, observation and document analysis were used to gather data. The participants in the research were corporate trainers, managers and trainees in 15 South African companies in which online learning is used as a training delivery mode. This study tried to involve companies in different industrial sectors. These included the energy, mining, insurance, banking, telecommunication, and services industrial sectors. In this study convenience sampling was used. The findings of this study appear to indicate that organisations in South Africa were competent in the integration of online learning for human resources development in the corporate training environment. This could be attributed to the fact managers and facilitators were using various strategies, techniques and online tools in their endeavours to integrate online learning in their training environment. The above-mentioned competence holds great promise for the future of the level of productivity in South African organisations.},

abstract = {Compared to other language tasks, applying pre-trained language models (PLMs) for search ranking often requires more nuances and training signals. In this paper, we identify and study the two mismatches between pre-training and ranking fine-tuning: the training schema gap regarding the differences in training objectives and model architectures, and the task knowledge gap considering the discrepancy between the knowledge needed in ranking and that learned during pre-training. To mitigate these gaps, we propose Pre-trained, Prompt-learned and Pre-finetuned Neural Ranker (P3 Ranker). P3 Ranker leverages prompt-based learning to convert the ranking task into a pre-training like schema and uses pre-finetuning to initialize the model on intermediate supervised tasks. Experiments on MS MARCO and Robust04 show the superior performances of P3 Ranker in few-shot ranking. Analyses reveal that P3 Ranker is able to better accustom to the ranking task through prompt-based learning and retrieve necessary ranking-oriented knowledge gleaned in pre-finetuning, resulting in data-efficient PLM adaptation.

abstract = {Code review is a practice widely adopted in open source and industrial projects. Given the non-negligible cost of such a process, researchers started investigating the possibility of automating specific code review tasks. We recently proposed Deep Learning (DL) models targeting the automation of two tasks: the first model takes as input a code submitted for review and implements in it changes likely to be recommended by a reviewer; the second takes as input the submitted code and a reviewer comment posted in natural language and automatically implements the change required by the reviewer. While the preliminary results we achieved are encouraging, both models had been tested in rather simple code review scenarios, substantially simplifying the targeted problem. This was also due to the choices we made when designing both the technique and the experiments. In this paper, we build on top of that work by demonstrating that a pre-trained Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) model can outperform previous DL models for automating code review tasks. Also, we conducted our experiments on a larger and more realistic (and challenging) dataset of code review activities.},

abstract = {There is a trend of researchers and practitioners to directly apply the pre-trained models to solve their specific tasks. For example, researchers in Software Engineering (SE) have successfully exploited the pre-trained language models to automatically generate the source code and comments. However, there are domain gaps in different benchmark datasets. These data-driven (or ML-based) models trained on one benchmark dataset may not operate smoothly on other benchmarks. Thus, the reuse of pre-trained models introduces large costs and additional problems of checking whether arbitrary pre-trained models are suitable for the task-specific reuse or not. To our knowledge, software engineers can leverage code contracts to maximize the reuse of existing software components or software services. Similar to the software reuse in the SE field, reuse software engineering could be extended to the area of pre-trained model reuse. Therefore, according to the model card’s and FactSheet’s guidance for suppliers of pre-trained models on what information they should be published, we propose model contracts including the pre- and post-conditions of pre-trained models to enable better model reuse. Furthermore, many non-trivial yet challenging issues have not been fully investigated, though many pre-trained models are readily available on the model repositories. Based on our model contract, we conduct an exploratory study of 1908 pre-trained models on six mainstream model repositories (i.e., the Tensorflow Hub, PyTorch Hub, Model Zoo, Wolfram neural net repository, Nvidia, and Hugging Face) to investigate the gap between necessary pre- and post-condition information and actual specifications. Our results clearly show that 1) the model repositories tend to provide confusing information of the pre-trained models, especially the information about the task’s type, model, training set; 2) the model repositories cannot provide all our proposed pre/post-condition information, especially the intended use, limitation, performance, and quantitative analysis. On the basis of our new findings, we suggest that 1) the developers of model repositories shall provide some necessary options (e.g., the training dataset, model algorithm, and performance measures) for each of pre/post-conditions of pre-trained models in each task type; 2) future researchers and practitioners provide more efficient metrics to recommend suitable pre-trained model; and 3) the suppliers of pre-trained models should report their pre-trained models in strict accordance with our proposed pre/post-condition and report their models according to the characteristics of each condition that has been reported in the model repositories.},

abstract = {Database access programming is a noteworthy component of Software Engineering (SE) education on databases that students are expected to acquire during training for their careers. In our university, we cover such an education in a course that emphasizes the use of the JDBC API to access databases. This paper presents our experiences in developing and running a framework to enhance the learning experience of database access programming, which is motivated by several factors. First, our students face great demands on acquiring JDBC acknowledge, and providing them with constructive feedback serves a critical role. Second, the increasing number of students leads to high efforts in managing and grading their assignments. Finally, we consider of strategic importance to bring modern industrial SE techniques into the classroom, so that students obtain a better experience with industry practices.Our framework draws upon constructive alignment and automated formative assessment, combining Continuous Integration (CI) and Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP). We include an innovative application of AOP, a programming technique that aims to modularize inherently scattered functionality into single functional units, to help students adopt well-established JDBC best practices. We also use well-known industrial software tools (Travis CI and GitHub) to manage and grade students' assignments and support automated integration testing with databases. The findings of this study, applied to a class of 53 students, suggest positive effects, such as motivate students to implement JDBC best practices, streamline the management and grading of their assignments, help them get familiar with industrial tools, or improve their grades.},

abstract = {Code completion is one of the most useful features in the Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), which can accelerate software development by suggesting the next probable token based on the contextual code in real-time. Recent studies have shown that statistical language modeling techniques can improve the performance of code completion tools through learning from large-scale software repositories. However, these models suffer from two major drawbacks: a) Existing research uses static embeddings, which map a word to the same vector regardless of its context. The differences in the meaning of a token in varying contexts are lost when each token is associated with a single representation; b) Existing language model based code completion models perform poor on completing identifiers, and the type information of the identifiers is ignored in most of these models. To address these challenges, in this paper, we develop a multi-task learning based pre-trained language model for code understanding and code generation with a Transformer-based neural architecture. We pre-train it with hybrid objective functions that incorporate both code understanding and code generation tasks. Then we fine-tune the pre-trained model on code completion. During the completion, our model does not directly predict the next token. Instead, we adopt multi-task learning to predict the token and its type jointly and utilize the predicted type to assist the token prediction. Experiments results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model when compared with state-of-the-art methods.},

We present an analysis of mistakes that students made when first working with SQL, classify the types of errors introduced, and provide suggestions on how to avoid them going forward. In addition, we present an automated tool, SQLRepair, that is capable of repairing errors introduced by undergraduate programmers when writing SQL queries. Our results show that students find repairs produced by our tool comparable in understandability to queries written by themselves or by other students, suggesting that SQL repair tools may be useful in an educational context. We also provide to the community a benchmark of SQL queries written by the students in our study that we used for evaluation of SQLRepair.},

abstract = {The Information Retrieval (IR) community has witnessed a flourishing development of deep neural networks, however, only a few managed to beat strong baselines. Among them, models like DRMM and DUET were able to achieve better results thanks to the proper handling of exact match signals. Nowadays, the application of pre-trained language models to IR tasks has achieved impressive results exceeding all previous work. In this paper, we assume that established IR cues like exact term-matching, proven to be valuable for deep neural models, can be used to augment the direct supervision from labeled data for training these pre-trained models. To study the effectiveness of this assumption, we propose MarkedBERT a modified version of one of the most popular pre-trained models via language modeling tasks, BERT. MarkedBERT integrates exact match signals using a marking technique that locates and highlights Exact Matched query-document terms using marker tokens. Experiments on MS MARCO Passage Ranking task show that our rather simple approach is actually effective. We find that augmenting the input with marker tokens allows the model to focus on valuable text sequences for IR.},

abstract = {Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have achieved great success in the area of Information Retrieval. Studies show that applying these models to ad-hoc document ranking can achieve better retrieval effectiveness. However, on the Web, most information is organized in the form of HTML web pages. In addition to the pure text content, the structure of the content organized by HTML tags is also an important part of the information delivered on a web page. Currently, such structured information is totally ignored by pre-trained models which are trained solely based on text content. In this paper, we propose to leverage large-scale web pages and their DOM (Document Object Model) tree structures to pre-train models for information retrieval. We argue that using the hierarchical structure contained in web pages, we can get richer contextual information for training better language models. To exploit this kind of information, we devise four pre-training objectives based on the structure of web pages, then pre-train a Transformer model towards these tasks jointly with traditional masked language model objective. Experimental results on two authoritative ad-hoc retrieval datasets prove that our model can significantly improve ranking performance compared to existing pre-trained models.},

abstract = {Pre-trained models of code have achieved success in many important software engineering tasks. However, these powerful models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that slightly perturb model inputs to make a victim model produce wrong outputs. Current works mainly attack models of code with examples that preserve operational program semantics but ignore a fundamental requirement for adversarial example generation: perturbations should be natural to human judges, which we refer to as naturalness requirement.In this paper, we propose ALERT (Naturalness Aware Attack), a black-box attack that adversarially transforms inputs to make victim models produce wrong outputs. Different from prior works, this paper considers the natural semantic of generated examples at the same time as preserving the operational semantic of original inputs. Our user study demonstrates that human developers consistently consider that adversarial examples generated by ALERT are more natural than those generated by the state-of-the-art work by Zhang et al. that ignores the naturalness requirement. On attacking CodeBERT, our approach can achieve attack success rates of 53.62%, 27.79%, and 35.78% across three downstream tasks: vulnerability prediction, clone detection and code authorship attribution. On GraphCodeBERT, our approach can achieve average success rates of 76.95%, 7.96% and 61.47% on the three tasks. The above outperforms the baseline by 14.07% and 18.56% on the two pre-trained models on average. Finally, we investigated the value of the generated adversarial examples to harden victim models through an adversarial fine-tuning procedure and demonstrated the accuracy of CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT against ALERT-generated adversarial examples increased by 87.59% and 92.32%, respectively.},

However, compared to costly training a large-scale model from scratch, how to effectively adapt pre-trained models to a new task has not been fully explored. In this paper, we propose an approach to bridge pre-trained models and code-related tasks. We exploit semantic-preserving transformation to enrich downstream data diversity, and help pre-trained models learn semantic features invariant to these semantically equivalent transformations. Further, we introduce curriculum learning to organize the transformed data in an easy-to-hard manner to fine-tune existing pre-trained models.We apply our approach to a range of pre-trained models, and they significantly outperform the state-of-the-art models on tasks for source code understanding, such as algorithm classification, code clone detection, and code search. Our experiments even show that without heavy pre-training on code data, natural language pre-trained model RoBERTa fine-tuned with our lightweight approach could outperform or rival existing code pre-trained models fine-tuned on the above tasks, such as CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT. This finding suggests that there is still much room for improvement in code pre-trained models.},

However, despite the great convenience for some developers, many are concerned that the code generators may recite or closely mimic copyrighted training data without user awareness, leading to legal and ethical concerns. To ease this problem, we introduce a tool, named WhyGen, to explain the generated code by referring to training examples. Specifically, we first introduce a data structure, named inference fingerprint, to represent the decision process of the model when generating a prediction. The fingerprints of all training examples are collected offline and saved to a database. When the model is used at runtime for code generation, the most relevant training examples can be retrieved by querying the fingerprint database. Our experiments have shown that WhyGen is able to precisely notify the users about possible recitations and highly similar imitations with a top-10 accuracy of 81.21%.

Recently, pre-training methods tailored for information retrieval (IR) have also been explored, and the latest success is the PROP method which has reached new SOTA on a variety of ad-hoc retrieval benchmarks. The basic idea of PROP is to construct therepresentative words prediction (ROP) task for pre-training inspired by the query likelihood model. Despite its exciting performance, the effectiveness of PROP might be bounded by the classical unigram language model adopted in the ROP task construction process. To tackle this problem, we propose a bootstrapped pre-training method (namely B-PROP) based on BERT for ad-hoc retrieval. The key idea is to use the powerful contextual language model BERT to replace the classical unigram language model for the ROP task construction, and re-train BERT itself towards the tailored objective for IR. Specifically, we introduce a novel contrastive method, inspired by the divergence-from-randomness idea, to leverage BERT's self-attention mechanism to sample representative words from the document. By further fine-tuning on downstream ad-hoc retrieval tasks, our method achieves significant improvements over PROP and other baselines, and further pushes forward the SOTA on a variety of ad-hoc retrieval tasks.},

This behavior can also be seen in education in software engineering, where learners tend to iterate over their models after having multiple discussions with their instructors or peers about possible solutions. This is an important part of the learning process, however, it is increasingly harder to implement for large scale on campus courses due to high student to lecturer ratios. One of the biggest problems is that lecturers are not able to allocate their time during class to support all students equally. This issue leads to new teaching methodologies and automated or semi-automated tools to support in-class interaction of students. However, these tools are lacking an automated mapping between questions asked and the teaching context provided. This context has to be inserted manually or is implicitly available during the lecture, however is lost after the lecture is over. In this paper we describe the adaption of a lecture-style instruction and the introduction of a context-aware Q&amp;A teaching framework to increase student interaction by parallelizing it with content delivery. We achieve this while also lowering barriers for students to participate, even in multi-classroom setups. The stated approach also allows the creation of a knowledge repository which persists student interaction including its teaching context. This repository can be used by students to prepare for upcoming exams as well as by instructors to optimize their teaching content. Using our approach, we are able to show that there is an increase in student participation, leading to increased student examination performance for active students.},

abstract = {Variable names are critical for conveying intended program behavior. Machine learning-based program analysis methods use variable name representations for a wide range of tasks, such as suggesting new variable names and bug detection. Ideally, such methods could capture semantic relationships between names beyond syntactic similarity, e.g., the fact that the names average and mean are similar. Unfortunately, previous work has found that even the best of previous representation approaches primarily capture "relatedness" (whether two variables are linked at all), rather than "similarity" (whether they actually have the same meaning).We propose VarCLR, a new approach for learning semantic representations of variable names that effectively captures variable similarity in this stricter sense. We observe that this problem is an excellent fit for contrastive learning, which aims to minimize the distance between explicitly similar inputs, while maximizing the distance between dissimilar inputs. This requires labeled training data, and thus we construct a novel, weakly-supervised variable renaming dataset mined from GitHub edits. We show that VarCLR enables the effective application of sophisticated, general-purpose language models like BERT, to variable name representation and thus also to related downstream tasks like variable name similarity search or spelling correction. VarCLR produces models that significantly outperform the state-of-the-art on IdBench, an existing benchmark that explicitly captures variable similarity (as distinct from relatedness). Finally, we contribute a release of all data, code, and pre-trained models, aiming to provide a drop-in replacement for variable representations used in either existing or future program analyses that rely on variable names.},

abstract = {The process of model checkpoint validation refers to the evaluation of the performance of a model checkpoint executed on a held-out portion of the training data while learning the hyperparameters of the model. This model checkpoint validation process is used to avoid over-fitting and determine when the model has converged so as to stop training. A simple and efficient strategy to validate deep learning checkpoints is the addition of validation loops to execute during training. However, the validation of dense retrievers (DR) checkpoints is not as trivial -- and the addition of validation loops is not efficient. This is because, in order to accurately evaluate the performance of a DR checkpoint, the whole document corpus needs to be encoded into vectors using the current checkpoint before any actual retrieval operation for checkpoint validation can be performed. This corpus encoding process can be very time-consuming if the document corpus contains millions of documents (e.g., 8.8M for MS MARCO v1 and 21M for Natural Questions). Thus, a na\"{\i}ve use of validation loops during training will significantly increase training time. To address this issue, we propose Asyncval: a Python-based toolkit for efficiently validating DR checkpoints during training. Instead of pausing the training loop for validating DR checkpoints, Asyncval decouples the validation loop from the training loop, uses another GPU to automatically validate new DR checkpoints and thus permits to perform validation asynchronously from training. Asyncval also implements a range of different corpus subset sampling strategies for validating DR checkpoints; these strategies allow to further speed up the validation process. We provide an investigation of these methods in terms of their impact on validation time and validation fidelity. Asyncval is made available as an open-source project at https://github.com/ielab/asyncval.},

abstract = {With machine learning models especially Deep Neural Network (DNN) models becoming an integral part of the new intelligent software, new tools to support their engineering process are in high demand. Existing DNN debugging tools are either post-training which wastes a lot of time training a buggy model and requires expertises, or limited on collecting training logs without analyzing the problem not even fixing them. In this paper, we propose AutoTrainer, a DNN training monitoring and automatic repairing tool which supports detecting and auto-repairing five commonly seen training problems. During training, it periodically checks the training status and detects potential problems. Once a problem is found, AutoTrainer tries to fix it by using built-in state-of-the-art solutions. It supports various model structures and input data types, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for texts. Our evaluation on 6 datasets, 495 models show that AutoTrainer can effectively detect all potential problems with 100% detection rate and no false positives. Among all models with problems, it can fix 97.33% of them, increasing the accuracy by 47.08% on average.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen the successful application of large pre-trained models to code representation learning, resulting in substantial improvements on many code-related downstream tasks. But there are issues surrounding their application to SE tasks. First, the majority of the pre-trained models focus on pre-training only the encoder of the Transformer. For generation tasks that are addressed using models with the encoder-decoder architecture, however, there is no reason why the decoder should be left out during pre-training. Second, many existing pre-trained models, including state-of-the-art models such as T5-learning, simply reuse the pretraining tasks designed for natural languages. Moreover, to learn the natural language description of source code needed eventually for code-related tasks such as code summarization, existing pretraining tasks require a bilingual corpus composed of source code and the associated natural language description, which severely limits the amount of data for pre-training. To this end, we propose SPT-Code, a sequence-to-sequence pre-trained model for source code. In order to pre-train SPT-Code in a sequence-to-sequence manner and address the aforementioned weaknesses associated with existing pre-training tasks, we introduce three pre-training tasks that are specifically designed to enable SPT-Code to learn knowledge of source code, the corresponding code structure, as well as a natural language description of the code without relying on any bilingual corpus, and eventually exploit these three sources of information when it is applied to downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that SPT-Code achieves state-of-the-art performance on five code-related downstream tasks after fine-tuning.},

Failing to meet this challenge can lead to misunderstandings that impede project success. To prepare practitioners for remote and diverse forms of communication we have developed VENTURE: a simulation-based training platform that aims to increase cultural awareness.Aim of study: Having developed a prototype training platform, we now assess whether VENTURE can deliver real learning and increase cultural awareness.Method: A survey was designed based on educational theory. Using a heuristic evaluation approach, a group of potential users trialed the system and completed a proof of learning survey before and after using the platform. Survey results, and VENTURE's own automated assessment scores, were analysed and compared.Results: Results indicate that the platform has the potential to provide useful and meaningful training for cultural awareness in GSD. A secondary result is that the assessment scheme proved useful in providing both evidence of learning and highlighting areas where VENTURE could be improved.Conclusion: Researchers and practitioners can gain an understanding of how to evaluate, train and measure soft skills, such as communication, important to all forms of software development. The methodology applied served to adapt the environment to the needs of potential users and the actual problems of GSD.},

In fact, there are usually abundant unlabeled user behavior data that encode rich universal user information, and pre-training user models on them can empower user modeling in many downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a user model pre-training method named UserBERT to learn universal user models on unlabeled user behavior data with two contrastive self-supervision tasks. The first one is masked behavior prediction and discrimination, aiming to model the contexts of user behaviors. The second one is behavior sequence matching, aiming to capture user interest stable in different periods. Besides, we propose a medium-hard negative sampling framework to select informative negative samples for better contrastive pre-training. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of UserBERT in user model pre-training.},

abstract = {Cold start is one of the most challenging problems in recommender systems. In this paper we tackle the cold-start problem by proposing a context-aware semi-supervised co-training method named CSEL. Specifically, we use a factorization model to capture fine-grained user-item context. Then, in order to build a model that is able to boost the recommendation performance by leveraging the context, we propose a semi-supervised ensemble learning algorithm. The algorithm constructs different (weak) prediction models using examples with different contexts and then employs the co-training strategy to allow each (weak) prediction model to learn from the other prediction models. The method has several distinguished advantages over the standard recommendation methods for addressing the cold-start problem. First, it defines a fine-grained context that is more accurate for modeling the user-item preference. Second, the method can naturally support supervised learning and semi-supervised learning, which provides a flexible way to incorporate the unlabeled data.The proposed algorithms are evaluated on two real-world datasets. The experimental results show that with our method the recommendation accuracy is significantly improved compared to the standard algorithms and the cold-start problem is largely alleviated.},

Through the interviews and accompanying landscape scan, we identify three broad approaches to platform-led upskilling---face-to-face, online, and in-workflow training moments---and several content types---platform proficiencies, financial and digital literacies, vocation-specific skills, and soft skills. This kind of training is important to current debates about digitization and the future of work because some platform-led upskilling aims to teach portable, lifelong skills, bringing platforms into the broader education landscape and potentially strengthening the social contract between platforms and vendors/workers. However, the scale at which platform-led upskilling will impact individuals and markets remains undetermined and needs further research.},

abstract = {Stack Overflow is often viewed as one of the most influential Software Question &amp; Answer (SQA) websites, containing millions of programming-related questions and answers. Tags play a critical role in efficiently structuring the contents in Stack Overflow and are vital to support a range of site operations, e.g., querying relevant contents. Poorly selected tags often introduce extra noise and redundancy, which raises problems like tag synonym and tag explosion. Thus, an automated tag recommendation technique that can accurately recommend high-quality tags is desired to alleviate the problems mentioned above.Inspired by the recent success of pre-trained language models (PTMs) in natural language processing (NLP), we present PTM4Tag, a tag recommendation framework for Stack Overflow posts that utilize PTMs with a triplet architecture, which models the components of a post, i.e., Title, Description, and Code with independent language models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that leverages PTMs in the tag recommendation task of SQA sites. We comparatively evaluate the performance of PTM4Tag based on five popular pre-trained models: BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, CodeBERT, and BERTOverflow. Our results show that leveraging CodeBERT, a software engineering (SE) domain-specific PTM in PTM4Tag achieves the best performance among the five considered PTMs and outperforms the state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network-based approach by a large margin in terms of average Precision@k, Recall@k, and F1-score@k. We conduct an ablation study to quantify the contribution of a post's constituent components (Title, Description, and Code Snippets) to the performance of PTM4Tag. Our results show that Title is the most important in predicting the most relevant tags, and utilizing all the components achieves the best performance.},

This paper presents a game called FormalZ that teachers can use to introduce some variation in their class. Students can have some fun in playing the game and, while doing so, also learn the basics of writing formal specifications in the form of pre- and post-conditions. Unlike existing software engineering themed education games such as Pex and Code Defenders, FormalZ takes the deep gamification approach where playing gets a more central role in order to generate more engagement. This short paper presents our work in progress: the first implementation of FormalZ along with the result of a preliminary users' evaluation. This implementation is functionally complete and tested, but the polishing of its user interface is still future work.},

abstract = {The pre-trained language models (PLMs), such as BERT and ERNIE, have achieved outstanding performance in many natural language understanding tasks. Recently, PLMs-based Information Retrieval models have also been investigated and showed substantially state-of-the-art effectiveness, e.g., MORES, PROP and ColBERT. Moreover, most of the PLMs-based rankers only focus on a single level relevance matching (e.g., character-level), while ignore the other granularity information (e.g., words and phrases), which easily lead to the ambiguity of query understanding and inaccurate matching issues in web search.In this paper, we aim to improve the state-of-the-art PLMs ERNIE for web search, by modeling multi-granularity context information with the awareness of word importance in queries and documents. In particular, we propose a novel H-ERNIE framework, which includes a query-document analysis component and a hierarchical ranking component. The query-document analysis component has several individual modules which generate the necessary variables, such as word segmentation, word importance analysis, and word tightness analysis. Based on these variables, the importance-aware multiple-level correspondences are sent to the ranking model. The hierarchical ranking model includes a multi-layer transformer module to learn the character-level representations, a word-level matching module, and a phrase-level matching module with word importance. Each of these modules models the query and the document matching from a different perspective. Also, these levels are inherently communicated to achieve the overall accurate matching. We discuss the time complexity of the proposed framework, and show that it can be efficiently implemented in real applications. The offline and online experiments on both public data sets and a commercial search engine illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed H-ERNIE framework.},

abstract = {Software traceability establishes and leverages associations between diverse development artifacts. Researchers have proposed the use of deep learning trace models to link natural language artifacts, such as requirements and issue descriptions, to source code; however, their effectiveness has been restricted by availability of labeled data and efficiency at runtime. In this study, we propose a novel framework called Trace BERT (T-BERT) to generate trace links between source code and natural language artifacts. To address data sparsity, we leverage a three-step training strategy to enable trace models to transfer knowledge from a closely related Software Engineering challenge, which has a rich dataset, to produce trace links with much higher accuracy than has previously been achieved. We then apply the T-BERT framework to recover links between issues and commits in Open Source Projects. We comparatively evaluated accuracy and efficiency of three BERT architectures. Results show that a Single-BERT architecture generated the most accurate links, while a Siamese-BERT architecture produced comparable results with significantly less execution time. Furthermore, by learning and transferring knowledge, all three models in the framework outperform classical IR trace models. On the three evaluated real-word OSS projects, the best T-BERT stably outperformed the VSM model with average improvements of 60.31% measured using Mean Average Precision (MAP). RNN severely underper-formed on these projects due to insufficient training data, while T-BERT overcame this problem by using pretrained language models and transfer learning.},

abstract = {Recently, many pre-trained language models for source code have been proposed to model the context of code and serve as a basis for downstream code intelligence tasks such as code completion, code search, and code summarization. These models leverage masked pre-training and Transformer and have achieved promising results. However, currently there is still little progress regarding interpretability of existing pre-trained code models. It is not clear why these models work and what feature correlations they can capture. In this paper, we conduct a thorough structural analysis aiming to provide an interpretation of pre-trained language models for source code (e.g., CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT) from three distinctive perspectives: (1) attention analysis, (2) probing on the word embedding, and (3) syntax tree induction. Through comprehensive analysis, this paper reveals several insightful findings that may inspire future studies: (1) Attention aligns strongly with the syntax structure of code. (2) Pre-training language models of code can preserve the syntax structure of code in the intermediate representations of each Transformer layer. (3) The pre-trained models of code have the ability of inducing syntax trees of code. Theses findings suggest that it may be helpful to incorporate the syntax structure of code into the process of pre-training for better code representations.},

abstract={The co-existence of various kinds of devices, protocols, architectures, and programming languages make Internet of Things (IoT) systems complex to develop, even for experienced programmers. Perforce, Software Engineering challenges are even more difficult to address by novice programmers. Previous research focused on identifying the most challenging issues that novice programmers experience when developing IoT systems. The results suggested that the integration of heterogeneous software components is one of the most painful issues, mainly due to the lack of documentation understandable by inexperienced developers, from both conceptual and technical perspectives. In fact, novice programmers devote a significant effort looking for documentation and code samples willing to understand them conceptually, or in the worst case, at least to make them work. Driven by the research question: "How do the lessons learned by IoT novice programmers can be captured, so they become an asset for other novice developers?", in this paper, we introduce Code Recipes. They consist of summarized and well-defined documentation modules, independent from programming languages or run-time environments, by which non-expert programmers can smoothly become familiar with source code, written by other developers that faced similar issues. Through a use case, we show how Code Recipes are a feasible mechanism to support novice IoT programmers in building their IoT systems.},

abstract={It has been 50 years since the term "software engineering" was coined in 1968 at a NATO conference. The field should be relatively mature by now, with most established universities covering core software engineering topics in their Computer Science programs and others offering specialized degrees. However, still many practitioners lament a lack of skills in new software engineering hires. With the growing demand for software engineers from the industry, this apparent gap becomes more and more pronounced. One corporate strategy to address this gap is for the industry to develop supplementary training programs before the hiring process, which could also help companies screen viable candidates. In this paper, we report on our experiences and lessons learned in conducting a summer school program aimed at screening new graduates, introducing them to core skills relevant to the organization and industry, and assessing their attitudes toward mastering those skills before the hiring process begins. Our experience suggests that such initiatives can be mutually beneficial for new hires and companies alike. We support this insight with pre- and post-training data collected from the participants during the first edition of the summer school and a follow-up questionnaire conducted after a year with the participants, 50% of whom were hired by the company shortly after the summer school.},

This is not complete training to become an IV&V engineer, but job training to help solve common problems encountered in IV&V work. The instructional design process featured extensive frontend analysis before the design and implementation of the instruction, and also repeated revision of the instruction. The Dick and Carey model influenced the process used for developing the IV&V training program, which we called J-IDP. We conducted a field trial with the entry level of the training materials, but the resultwas not as positive as expected. Therefore, following J-IDP, we reviewed the materials and revised the training. Our experience with this training program suggests applying an instructional design process may solve some aspects of two common issues for software engineering education or training, the difficulty in identifying necessary abilities for software engineers and the difficulty in maintaining the training up-to-date.},

In this study, we coin the term `newcomer candidate' to describe new users to the GitHub platform. Our objective is to track and characterize their initial contributions. As a preliminary survey, we collected 208 newcomer candidate contributions in GitHub. Using this dataset, we then plan to track their contributions to reveal insights. We will use a mixed-methods approach, i.e., quantitative and qualitative, to identify whether or not newcomer candidates practice social coding, the kinds of their contributions, projects they target, and the proportion that they eventually onboard to an OSS project.},

abstract={With a volatile labour and technological market, onboarding is becoming increasingly important. The process of incorporating a new developer, a.k.a. the newcomer, into a software development team is reckoned to be lengthy, frustrating and expensive. Newcomers face personal, interpersonal, process and technical barriers during their incorporation, which, in turn, affects the overall productivity of the whole team. This problem exacerbates for Software Product Lines (SPLs), where their size and variability combine to make onboarding even more challenging, even more so for developers that are transferred from the Application Engineering team into the Domain Engineering team, who will be our target newcomers. This work presents concept maps on the role of sensemaking scaffolds to help to introduce these newcomers into the SPL domain. Concept maps, used as knowledge visualisation tools, have been proven to be helpful for meaningful learning. Our main insight is to capture concepts of the SPL domain and their interrelationships in a concept map, and then, present them incrementally, helping newcomers grasp the SPL and aiding them in exploring it in a guided manner while avoiding information overload. This work's contributions are four-fold. First, concept maps are proposed as a representation to introduce newcomers into the SPL domain. Second, conceptmaps are presented as the means for a guided exploration of the SPL core assets. Third, a feature-driven concept map construction process is introduced. Last, the usefulness of concept maps as guides for SPL onboarding is tested through a formative evaluation.},

This paper questions the validity of this commonly-held belief about the educational value of conventional patterns, arguing that although there is tremendous value in capturing and disseminating software engineering experience in the form of patterns, conventional design patterns cannot deliver on this expectation to significantly shorten the experience growth curve. We report initial results from an ongoing research project that aims to not only identify the difficulties in using conventional patterns as educational means for novices, but also to use such insights to develop new forms of patterns to help educators and experts to more effectively communicate and transfer their software engineering knowledge, experience, and understanding of best practices to novices.},

Specifically, the concept involves an inquisitive code editor that: (1) identifies misconceptions by periodically prompting the novice programmer with questions about their program's behavior, (2) corrects the misconceptions by generating explanations based on the program's actual behavior, and (3) prevents further misconceptions by inserting test code and utilizing other educational resources. We have implemented portions of the concept as plugins for the Atom code editor and conducted informal surveys with students and instructors. Next steps include deploying the tool prototype to students enrolled in introductory programming courses.},

abstract={The Engineering training course takes the responsibility of cultivating students' innovation, team cooperation and practical operation ability. Now there are two ways to improve the innovation training performance in the engineering practical course. The most popular way is to carry on a project-based curriculum which has the practical training as one section of the course. Another way is to create new practice teaching methods. Our research is a combination of the project curriculum and the innovative training methods. It is focused on the Virtual reality (VR) for the engineering practice teaching. First of all, the project-based course named "Comprehensive innovation training" was offered for the junior or senior students. VR methods applied for the practice course was one of the projects in the course. Instructors built the initial model from the real practice situation into the virtual environment by the software Unreal Engine (UE) 4, and guided students the basic operation of the software. Then the students in the class would design the motion of the equipment based on the reality rules, finish the operating system with the VR device, and debug the program for the final application. Thirdly, this project was applied as an assistant practice method for the sophomores in their practice training class, and the students would give feedbacks to the system. Finally, when those sophomore students become juniors and seniors, they could involve in the project-based course, and contribute to the VR training project. Now the project is carried on, and the model of drilling machine and lathe machine are established in the virtual environment. The engineering practice assistant training system based on VR has already applied for the junior students, and some of feedbacks have been received. There is 81 percent of the students shown interest in the new method. As the platform depends on the open source software, and the whole project is sustainable and the system will be abundant in the next few years.},

Health information technology talents not only learn basic information technology skills such as software development, software implementation, software testing, but also learn database management, software installation, software usage, maintenance and other professional knowledge of health information system. In order to better carry out the training of health information technology talents, we jointly recruit modern apprenticeship class students with health and medical information enterprises. This paper expounds how to educate people through work-integrated learning, school-enterprise cooperation and other ways. Compared with the ordinary students of the same grade, the students in the apprenticeship class have adapted to the working and learning mode of health information enterprises, and can independently complete the tasks of health information system development and project implementation, with stronger hands-on ability. The training of health information technology talents based on modern apprenticeship system has a good effect.},

abstract={Mentoring project newcomers is a crucial activity in software projects, and requires to identify people having good communication and teaching skills, other than high expertise on specific technical topics. In this demo we present Yoda (Young and newcOmer Developer Assistant), an Eclipse plugin that identifies and recommends mentors for newcomers joining a software project. Yoda mines developers' communication (e.g., mailing lists) and project versioning systems to identify mentors using an approach inspired to what ArnetMiner does when mining advisor/student relations. Then, it recommends appropriate mentors based on the specific expertise required by the newcomer. The demo shows Yoda in action, illustrating how the tool is able to identify and visualize mentoring relations in a project, and suggest appropriate mentors for a developer who is going to work on certain source code files, or on a given topic.

abstract={Large-scale distributed software projects with long life cycles often involve a considerable amount of complex legacy code. The combination of scale and distribution challenges and the difficulty in acquiring knowledge about massive amounts of complex legacy code may make the onboarding of new developers/teams problematic. These problems may lead to extended periods of low performance. The primary objective of this paper is to investigate the performance evolution of offshore newcomers onboarded in a large-scale globally distributed project and how it relates to the employed onboarding strategy. To achieve our objective, we conducted a case study in Ericsson. We identified that the following aspects in the onboarding strategy employed in the investigated case seem to be related to the unexpectedly low performance evolution: i) the distance to mentors; ii) the used formal training approach, which did not fit the sociocultural background of the newcomers; iii) allocation of large and distributed tasks in the early stages of the onboarding process; and iv) team instability. We conclude that the onboarding of newcomers in globally distributed projects must be planned well ahead and should consider avoiding the aspects mentioned above.},

abstract={The success of a software company is largely dependent upon the people who comprise the company. Given the pace at which most software needs to be produced, software companies need to make sure that new developers become as productive as quickly as possible when hired. The process of integrating new hires, often referred as onboarding, has been well studied in the context of large companies that have significant resources to bring to bear on the process. How onboarding occurs in smaller companies with fewer resources is less understood. To investigate how smaller companies address onboarding, we performed a case study, interviewing eight developers from a local company with a development team of about 100. We asked the developers what practices they experienced during their onboarding with the company. We found a high reliance on a buddy system and extensive use of code reviews to instruct developers in best practices.},

pages={202-210},
abstract={Theories of action study what an actor do, in a given situation, in order to achieve consequence or objectives. Argyris and Schoumln made a distinction between espoused theories - those that an individual claims to follow - and theories-in-use - those that can be inferred from action -. In the software engineering field, software processes and practices constitute the espoused theory, since it is what engineers claim to follow. But what engineers - and especially apprentices - do may reveal a different theory-in-use. The capstone project provides students, working in groups, with the possibility to reflect on her/his action and that may help making explicit theories-in-use. The course of action theory considers the observable aspect of the actor's activity, i.e., what is presentable, accountable and commentable. The course-of-action observatory collects data on the courses-of-action. This observatory connects continuous observations and recordings of the agents' behavior, the provoked verbalizations of these agents in activity and the agents' comments in self confrontation with recordings of their behavior. A case study, based on the activity of a team of 6 young software engineer apprentices is used to illustrate the building and the data collecting of the course-of-action observatory and the self-reconstruction of apprentices' activity. As primary results of this work, we may think that self-observing and self-analyzing software engineer's activity help to reveal her/his theory-in-use - what governs engineers' behavior and tends to be tacit structures -and it may help them to learn more suitable theories-in-use, thus contributing to improve productivity and performance. In the special case of apprenticeship learning, it may form a part of an appropriate education intended to develop a reflective attitude.},

abstract={Significant changes are occurring in the US software job market that may require revised academic curricula for software engineers and computer science students at the university level. There has long been debate about whether academic training at the university level should be oriented toward the fundamental theories of software engineering and computer science or toward a more practical curriculum of immediate relevance to those job markets. By and large, the theoretical side seems to be dominant in the US (and in Europe). US academic institutions tend to lack courses in several topics required for professional software production. As a result, recent college graduates in any technical domain usually require mentoring and on-the-job training before they can be entrusted with significant assignments. Large corporations normally supplement gaps in academic training with extensive entry-level training for new software employees. But as employment in these companies declines, smaller companies hire a larger percentage of new graduates. Small companies seldom and usually cannot afford to offer entry-level training. Therefore, both graduates and employers would benefit if US universities and colleges better prepared graduates for typical software work experiences.<>},

Those problems could be solved using Software Engineering practices. However, most of those practices are designed to satisfy projects requiring teamwork, and its adaption to single developer context is determined by developer's experience and skills. On the other hand, the Initial Software Development Method, (MIDS as in Spanish Método Inicial de Desarrollo de Software), was developed to train novice software engineers in software development, project management and teamwork practices. This method was adapted to a single developer context. Results show that MIDS can be easily adapted to be used in single developer contexts, without changing its essence.},

A wide selection of actions has been focused into getting more women for the STEM industries. However, the results have not been as efficient that would have hoped for. This study addresses the question how high-educated women perceive the attractiveness of software engineering studies. The data for the paper is collected with an open internet survey (n=134) from Finnish women who have already done or are planning to make a career change to the software industry. The attitudes towards new and old modes of learning and education are surveyed. This study shows that women perceive industry as attractive and value university education, yet there are overabundance of offering in entry-level training courses and lack of advanced studies. The university education is perceived to be rigid and old-fashioned.},

abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the way that software development teams onboard new hires. Previously, most software developers worked in physical offices and new hires onboarded to their teams in the physical office, following a standard onboarding process. However, when companies transitioned employees to work from home due to the pandemic, there was little to no time to develop new onboarding procedures. In this paper, we present a survey of 267 new hires at Microsoft that onboarded to software development teams during the pandemic. We explored their remote onboarding process, including the challenges that the new hires encountered and their social connectedness with their teams. We found that most developers onboarded remotely and never had an opportunity to meet their teammates in person. This leads to one of the biggest challenges faced by these new hires, building a strong social connection with their team. We use these results to provide recommendations for onboarding remote hires.},

abstract={Context: It is not uncommon for a new team member to join an existing Agile software development team, even after development has started. This new team member faces a number of challenges before they are integrated into the team and can contribute productively to team progress. Ideally, each newcomer should be supported in this transition through an effective team onboarding program, although prior evidence suggests that this is challenging for many organisations. Objective: We seek to understand how Agile teams address the challenge of team onboarding in order to inform future onboarding design. Method: We conducted an interview survey of eleven participants from eight organisations to investigate what onboarding activities are common across Agile software development teams. We also identify common goals of onboarding from a synthesis of literature. A repertory grid instrument is used to map the contributions of onboarding techniques to onboarding goals. Results: Our study reveals that a broad range of team onboarding techniques, both formal and informal, are used in practice. It also shows that particular techniques that have high contributions to a given goal or set of goals. Conclusions: In presenting a set of onboarding goals to consider and an evidence-based mechanism for selecting techniques to achieve the desired goals it is expected that this study will contribute to better-informed onboarding design and planning. An increase in practitioner awareness of the options for supporting new team members is also an expected outcome.},

abstract={Agile approaches to software development offer flexibility and autonomy to developers, while demanding discipline and attentiveness. At its best, agile constitutes an idealized vision of Wenger’s Community of Practice: one where the essence of the software practice is freely negotiated by participants following self-determined trajectories of identity within the community. While agile frameworks prescribe ways of doing, in reality these codified practices must adapt to a real workplace. Nowhere is this more plainly seen than in the onboarding stage of new employees: this is the point where newcomers establish an identity and establish means of participating within the development community.We report on the evolving nature of onboarding and mentoring at a mature software development firm that has practiced Scrum for a decade. As the firm has scaled up to an international purveyor of specialized engineering software and services, the way in which new employees are brought into the community of practice has changed profoundly. We view this history through a series of lenses: those of workplace participants entering the firm at different stages of the firm’s history. We follow the history of the onboarding process through the perspectives of several employees, and we focus on the trajectories of certain key employees as their roles change from novice to mentor.},

abstract={Software development in the automotive domain has been subject to changing and evolving processes for the last 15 years. As a result, the functionality of a vehicle is now developed independently of the target platform and communication technology. The actual mapping constraints to a hardware platform are then represented by a large parameter set stored in a configuration. This paradigm has spawned a heterogeneous tool environment for development of electronic control units (ECUs). On the one hand, this proceeding facilitates the development of reusable vehicle functions but on the other hand increases the difficulty for testing as well as error localization in the actual end system. The architecture of choice for platform independent ECU development in the automotive industry in Europe is AUTOSAR, which is in itself very complex but essential for automotive software developers. This makes it vital that students and junior developers of automotive software engineering can be trained in a fast and concise, industry-oriented way. In this paper, we present an educational concept which focuses on the inter-connections between different development and test phases in the automotive industry. It is mainly realized around two self-developed tools, which support learners and power a learning management system, all backed by an extensive AUTOSAR knowledge base. This system eases the learning and comprehension of automotive software development and test by hands-on-learning for both students and professional developers.},

Specifically, training is necessary for the development of quality software which is dependent on knowledgeable and skilled employees. They, in turn, will perform their roles more effectively and efficiently. It is as important for new hires as it is for current employees. Therefore, training is an on-going and never-ending process. In addition, training plays a key role in handling growth, which is what the GSM project is so fortunate to be experiencing today. However, growth is only positive if you are prepared to handle it and keep up with it. When a high growth rate is added to existing demands, the training challenge is multiplied. It is the purpose of this paper to share the steps the GSM project has taken to produce, implement and improve (through feedback) a well-rounded Software Engineering Institute (SEI) level three capability training program. This paper focuses on the resources (i.e., people and capital) and the components (e.g. mentoring, curriculums, individual training plans, in-house training, metrics) that are essential in establishing and managing a smooth-running training program for a software development organization. This paper also demonstrates the growing demand for knowledge and how its reuse is necessary to increase the Motorola knowledge base at a rate that allows Motorola to remain an industry leader.},

Too many academics focus on the latest tools, methods and technique while they ignore a number of the important lessons new engineers must master. While many assert that what differentiates a novice from a master is the number of patterns they can recognize and then leverage for their benefit, becoming a master is so much more. Earning the respect of the client and maintaining it through the entire project is as important as the required technical skills. Being able to continuously find the risks, technical and others, and having the skill to manage them as they change is equally crucial. Truly successful software engineers in today's turbulent world must demonstrate knowledge, skill and wisdom in business relationships to the same degree they are able to solve technical problems. This presentation will survey what we have learned about bringing predictability and quality to the development of high value systems. It will then focus on the importance of addressing both knowledge and skill aspects of software engineering in the context of a professional's career.

abstract={Recent literature reports a fair amount of initiatives on how to engage younger populations in achieving computational literacy. However, there is considerable less research on how to effectively deliver software development skills in a way that can be accepted and ultimately adopted by this user group. As a way to bridge this gap, we ran an extracurricular project-based workshop, targeting 10-12 years old learners with no prior coding experience, delivered over five days in the computer labs at the University of Chile. In this workshop, participants follow hands-on activities where they acquire the basics of computer programming and develop a small-scale software application using Scratch. These activities showcase that good software engineering practices can be taught to K-6 students, where these students are guided by experienced computer science undergraduate and graduate students. This paper presents a descriptive case study that focuses on assessing how K-6 learners assimilate and use these practices when developing their first computing application in a non-traditional learning experience. In order to do this, we designed and calibrated a rubric to evaluate the software products generated by the workshop participants. Our findings provide further evidence that it is indeed possible to teach initial notions of software engineering to this user group, structuring these constructs in a non-technical language that can be assimilated by novice developers. Furthermore, we did not observe significant differences in this matter according to gender and socio-economic status.},

In this study, we investigate whether and how contributions from developers with low experience in a project do receive a different treatment during code review. We compare reviewers' experience, metrics of reviewers' attention, and change merge rate between changes from newcomers and from more experienced authors in 60 active open source projects. We find that the only phenomenon that is consistent across the vast majority of projects is a lower merge rate for newcomers' changes.},

abstract={We report on the experience of the first offering of the course, "The Craft of Software Development." The purpose of the course is to identify and remediate individual weaknesses as software developers. Each student was asked to pick a personal learning focus in an area of known software development weakness for that student. Through a "maiden speech" they asked their class community for help in creating a learning plan to address their area of weakness. Learning plans typically incorporated known apprenticeship patterns such as "Find a Coach," "Breakable Toys," and "Practice, Practice, Practice." After creating their learning plan, students identified metrics to track their progress towards their goal. While executing their individual learning plans, the class performed programming katas which are specific programming exercises to work on issues relevant for the entire class. Several issues emerged in the first offering in the course and several suggestions are provided for incorporation in the next offering of the course.},

abstract={Student attitudes toward courses with heavy workloads vary depending on how they assess the value and difficulty of the material. In computer science, it is challenging to teach software engineering because the course relies heavily on ldquosoft skillsrdquo and also because students view the material as ldquocommon senserdquo and the assignments as ldquobusy work.rdquo In order to change these attitudes, we changed our junior-level software engineering course to incorporate a weekly laboratory session in order to meet two goals: to reinforce topics that students struggled with during earlier offerings and to make the course more ldquohands onrdquo and applied. This modification in course structure resulted in increased student satisfaction with the course and engagement with the material.},

abstract={The number of studies focusing on onboarding in software organizations has increased significantly during the last years. However, current literature overlooks onboarding in Software Product Lines (SPLs). SPLs have been proven effective in managing the increasing variability of industry software and enabling systematic reuse of a product family. Despite these benefits, SPLs are complex and exhibit particular characteristics that distinguish them from traditional software. Due to these peculiarities, SPLs require a tailor-made onboarding process. Assistance tools might help. In this dissertation, we propose assistance tools (i.e., tools built on top of the software project that help learners understand and develop knowledge) as a means for helping newcomers during onboarding in SPLs.},

abstract={Engineering ethics often receives attention in separate courses or modules, however other critical elements of professionalism are not directly addressed in a curriculum. Graduates coming to industry frequently lack proficiency in vital skills such as being adept in appropriate interpersonal communications, quickly adapting to industry protocols, and effectively acclimating to corporate hierarchy, culture and accountability. Many programs assume that professionalism is indirectly socialized through faculty modeling and classroom management. Such an assumption does not serve our students well, or the SE industry that hires them and then must put a tremendous effort into new employee orientation to create a productive work environment. This highly interactive tutorial provides practical resources for those who seek to introduce professionalism education into the SE curriculum but cannot create whole new courses devoted to the subject. Participants who will come away with concrete plans to assess, create, and integrate professional development opportunities into their academic Software Engineering curricula or industry training programs. This tutorial is a fertile opportunity for SE educators, advisors, administrators and representatives from SE undergraduate professional societies who want to respond to a vital concern for many campuses.},

year={2021},

pages={501-505},
abstract={While open source software (OSS) development projects always seek contributions from newcomers to make the projects sustainable, newcomers often face with a challenge of onboarding. For developers with little experience, it is difficult to decide which of the many OSS projects to contribute to and which issues to tackle. To mitigate the barrier against onboarding, some OSS projects start using a label so called good first issue (GFI) which indicates the issue is easy to resolve and suitable for newcomers to tackle. The final goal of this study is to construct a model for recommending good first issues to help reduce maintainers' manual effort of selecting and labeling issues as GFIs and at the same time to help find GFIs suitable for each newcomer. Toward the final goal, we analyze GFIs in GitHub to deeply understand the current state of the GFI mechanism and its impact on new members' onboarding. This paper reports a result of our preliminary analysis of GFIs, based on 9,475 GFIs collected from 11 famous OSS projects in GitHub. We find that (1) developers who have resolved GFIs have 92 fewer median PR (pull request) posts than developers who have resolved regular issues (i.e., developers tackling GFIs have less experience, compared to other developers), (2) on average, GFIs are resolved 32.5% more than regular issues (i.e., GFIs are easier to resolve. The dataset of GFIs might be able to be used as a training set for recommending GFIs to developers with less experience), and however (3) the percentage of developers who keep contributing to the same project even after resolving GFIs varies greatly from project to project (24.9% to 83.9%) (i.e, GFIs guide newcomers' onboarding only in particular projects). Based on the analysis result, we discuss the contents of GFIs which tend to keep newcomers on OSS projects.},

abstract={Education of junior college is employment-oriented and good occupational ability training is very important for students' future work and career development after graduation. Using group analytic hierarchy process (Group-AHP), a model for evaluating the comprehensive occupational abilities of engineering students in junior college has been built in this study and this model is composed of objective level, criteria level and index level. Criteria level includes 3 factors of basic capacity, major skill and key competency. Index level includes 14 indices: work ethics, judgment and discrimination, teamwork, humanity, language performance, computer operation, occupational position knowledge, technical proficiency, practical operating ability, application ability of new materials, processes and techniques as well as new facilities, interpersonal communication, psychological endurance, organizational managing ability, development and innovation, etc. The results have shown that, among the comprehensive occupational abilities of students, interpersonal communication, practical operation ability, teamwork, etc. have the largest weights, which is consistent with the teaching objective of junior college towards engineering students. Based on this model, grades of comprehensive occupational abilities of students could be calculated scientifically to provide the basis for improving the teaching quality, model and methods of college.},

pages={51-60},
abstract={When newcomers try to join an open source software (OSS) project, they face many barriers that hinder their first contribution, leading in many cases to their dropping out. Many projects leverage the contribution of outsiders, and the sustainability of the project relies on retaining some of these newcomers. This research aims to identify the barriers that hinder newcomers' onboarding to OSS projects. Our method consisted of a qualitative study conducted with data obtained from four different sources: (i) systematic literature review; (ii) feedback from nine graduate and undergraduate students after they tried to join OSS projects; (iii) 24 responses to a questionnaire sent to 9 OSS projects; and (iv) semi-structured interviews with 36 subjects from 14 different projects, including newcomers and experienced members. The method to select the candidate papers in the systematic literature review was querying four digital libraries and backward snowballing. The data obtained from the practitioners from all three sources, and the primary studies obtained in the systematic review were analyzed using used procedures of Grounded Theory's open and axial coding. The analysis resulted in a conceptual model composed of 58 barriers, grouped into six different categories: cultural differences, newcomers' characteristics, reception issues, orientation, technical hurdles, and documentation problems. We could observe recurrent barriers evidenced in different data sources. We could notice that the onboarding process of a newcomer to an OSS can be a tough task. This research brings empirical support relying on data from different sources, organizes and discusses the existing common wisdom about barriers faced by newcomers to OSS projects, which deserve attention from researchers and OSS communities.},

pages={69-81},
abstract={Debugging can be challenging for novice and expert programmers alike. Programmers routinely turn to online resources such as Stack Overflow for help, but understanding of debugging search practices, as well as tool support to find debugging resources, remains limited. Existing tools that mine online help forums are generally not aimed at novices, and programmers face varying levels of success when looking for online resources. Furthermore, training online code search skills is pedagogically challenging, as we have little understanding of how expertise impacts programmers’ web search behavior while debugging code.We help fill these knowledge gaps with the results of a study of 40 programmers investigating differences in Stack Overflow search behavior at three levels of expertise: novices, experienced programmers who are novices in Python (the language we use in our study), and experienced Python programmers. We observe significant differences between all three levels in their ability to find posts helpful for debugging a given error, with both general and language-specific expertise facilitating Stack Overflow search efficacy and debugging success. We also conduct an exploratory investigation of factors that correlate with this difference, such as the display rank of the selected link and the number of links checked per search query. We conclude with an analysis of how online search behavior and results vary by Python error type. Our findings can inform online code search pedagogy, as well as inform the development of future automated tools.},

abstract={It remains unclear when it is the right time to introduce software quality into the computing curriculum. Introductory students often cannot afford to also worry about software quality, while advanced students may have been groomed into undisciplined development practices already. To answer these questions satisfactorily, educators need strong quantitative evidence about the pervasiveness of software quality problems in software written by novice programmers. This paper presents a comprehensive study of software quality practices of novice programmers writing Scratch programs. By focusing on finding code smells-coding patterns indicative of quality problems-we analyze a longitudinal dataset of 100+ novice Scratch programmers and close to 3K of their programs. Even after gaining proficiency, students continue to introduce the same quality problems into their code, suggesting a need for timely educational interventions. Given the importance of software quality for modern society, computing educators should teach quality concepts and practices alongside the core computing curriculum.},

abstract={In a training process for DSP software developers' major schools and scientific societies see an actual problem for a kind of transformation from a traditional form of training into different remote forms, using one-to-many online training courses and interactive case study. We have analyzed many different examples of such a new forms of trainings that have been used or trialed by major technical universities. Within our analysis we have defined requirements for automatic training system (ATS) for a developers of DSP software. The major goal for specified ATS should be a possibility for any trainee to get a knowledge and skills in a practical stand-alone way, with near zero interaction with anyone else except ATS. Basic scenarios, short tests allows trainee not only get soft-start and to achieve fast wins, but also motivate him for a professional development and deeply involve him into process of SDP software development. Comparing to widely and massively used courses covering basic tasks and general questions of DSP software development, proposed ATS is more specialized and requires higher level of entry qualification for trainee. From practical point of view we suppose to include game-approach and real-time interaction with trainee during whole process of ATS. This leads to a problem of real-time computation and real-time automating for a trainees solution check and giving a relevant feedback in a way of showing radio signal in a logical visual way both for source and processed signals. This allows forming right understanding not only for SDP software development skills but also understanding of major functional principles of complex radio systems. For example, for DSP ECC decoding we are using visualized encoded and decoded signals, and for spectrum processing tasks we are using visualized spectrum areas. Another interesting approach is to use the best solutions done by trainees to include them into a kind of knowledge library for further use. Today we have implemented proposed approach onto SW being deployed and used during courses of DSP software development from year of 2016. We see first outcome of usage this ATS.},

abstract={Students with little professional software development experience typically have low intrinsic motivation and beyond achieving a good grade, low extrinsic motivation to study and appreciate the value of software engineering curricula. Unlike other subjects, introductory software engineering instructors exert a great deal of effort justifying and motivating their course topics. Since 2006 the University of Hawaii has been developing a series of “early awareness” engagements within an introductory Systems Analysis and Design course designed to foster intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and orient students to value learning software engineering. Measuring motivation and perceived value is difficult, but there are key indicators to determine the impact of our improvements such as higher course evaluations, greater class attendance, and increased positive feedback from students and employers. Our results show that these key indicators have improved since introducing early engagements. Furthermore, students like this approach, value the course more, do better quality work, and evaluate the course more positively. Longitudinal follow-ups indicate greater interest and success in pursuing software engineering related careers. This paper shares the details of our early awareness engagements, how they are applied in the classroom, some of our experiences in using them, and evidence that they have a positive impact. Our goal is to provide specific and practical means that instructors can use immediately to improve the perceived value of software engineering for novice students prior to or while they study it.},

abstract={Attracting and retaining newcomers are critical aspects for OSS projects, as such projects rely on newcomers sustainable contributions. Considerable effort has been made to help newcomers by identifying and overcoming the barriers during the onboarding process. However, most newcomers eventually fail and drop out of their projects even after successful onboarding. Meanwhile, it has been long known that individuals early career stages profoundly impact their long-term career success. However, newcomers early careers are less investigated in SE research. In this paper, we sought to develop an empirical understanding of the relationships between newcomers dynamic contribution patterns in their early careers and their technical success. To achieve this goal, we compiled a dataset of newcomers contribution data from 54 large OSS projects under three different ecosystems and analyzed it with time series analysis and other statistical analysis techniques. Our analyses yield rich findings. The correlations between several contribution patterns and technical success were identified. In general, being consistent and persistent in newcomers early careers is positively associated with their technical success. While these correlations generally hold in all three ecosystems, we observed some differences in detailed contribution patterns correlated with technical success across ecosystems. In addition, we performed a case study to investigate whether another type of contributions, i.e., documentation contribution, could potentially have positive correlations with newcomers technical success. We discussed the implications and summarized practical recommendations to OSS newcomers. The insights gained from this work demonstrated the necessity of extending the focus of research and practice to newcomers early careers and hence shed light on future research in this direction.},

abstract={The recent and fast expansion of OSS (Open-source software) communities has fostered research on how open source projects evolve and how their communities interact. Several research studies show that the inflow of new developers plays an important role in the longevity and the success of OSS projects. Beside that they also discovered that an high percentage of newcomers tend to leave the project because of the socio-technical barriers they meet when they join the project. However, such research effort did not generate yet concrete results in support retention and training of project newcomers. In this thesis dissertation we investigated problems arising when newcomers join software projects, and possible solutions to support them. Specifically, we studied (i) how newcomers behave during development activities and how they interact with others developers with the aim at (ii) developing tools and/or techniques for supporting them during the integration in the development team. Thus, among the various recommenders, we defined (i) a tool able to suggest appropriate mentors to newcomers during the training stage; then, with the aim at supporting newcomers during program comprehension we defined other two recommenders: A tool that (ii) generates high quality source code summaries and another tool able to (iii) provide descriptions of specific source code elements. For future work, we plan to improve the proposed recommenders and to integrate other kind of recommenders to better support newcomers in OSS projects.},

abstract={Community-based Open Source Software (OSS) projects are usually self-organized and dynamic, receiving contributions from distributed volunteers. These communities' survival, long-term success, and continuity demand a constant influx of newcomers. However, newcomers face many barriers when making their first contribution to an OSS project, leading in many cases to dropouts. Therefore, a major challenge for OSS projects is to provide ways to support newcomers during their first contribution. In this paper, our goal was to evaluate how the newcomers' perceived efficacy is influenced by the use of an environment that organizes the project information for developers who want to place their first contribution to an OSS project. To accomplish this goal, we created FLOSS coach, a portal aiming to support newcomers to OSS projects, which was implemented based on a model of barriers proposed in previous research. Then, we conducted a study, in which 46 students, split in case and control group, were asked to contribute to an OSS project. We assessed the newcomers' self-efficacy by conducting a questionnaire before and after the assignment. We found that presenting the information according to the model of barriers had a positive influence on newcomers' self-efficacy, empowered the newcomers, making them more confident and comfortable during the contribution process. However, there is also some indication that FLOSS coach did not lower the technical barriers.},

abstract={Attracting and retaining newcomers is vital for the sustainability of an open-source software project. However, it is difficult for new-comers to locate suitable development tasks, while existing “Good First Issues” (GFI) in GitHub are often insufficient and inappropriate. In this paper, we propose RECGFI, an effective practical approach for the recommendation of good first issues to newcomers, which can be used to relieve maintainers' burden and help newcomers onboard. RECGFI models an issue with features from multiple dimensions (content, background, and dynamics) and uses an XGBoost classifier to generate its probability of being a GFI. To evaluate RECGFI, we collect 53,510 resolved issues among 100 GitHub projects and care-fully restore their historical states to build ground truth datasets. Our evaluation shows that RECGFI can achieve up to 0.853 AUC in the ground truth dataset and outperforms alternative models. Our interpretable analysis of the trained model further reveals in-teresting observations about GFI characteristics. Finally, we report latest issues (without GFI-signaling labels but recommended as GFI by our approach) to project maintainers among which 16 are confirmed as real GFIs and five have been resolved by a newcomer.},

abstract={Programming ability is an important factor influencing programmers to develop software. As a novice programmer who has just entered the world of software development, it is very important to improve their programming ability. In universities, as the main group of novice programmers, college students have relatively weak programming ability, and programming ability is an important factor that affects students' practical ability. However, subject competitions help to improve the creative ability and practical ability of college students. In order to study whether participating in subject competitions has an impact on the improvement of students' programming ability, a related questionnaire was designed. The collected questionnaire data and programming ability prediction data were preprocessed, and the Spearman correlation analysis was performed on the both. The research results show that college students participating in the competition have a greater impact on the improvement of their own programming ability, and students' interest in participating in the competition can affect the participation in the competition and the improvement of students' programming ability at the same time. Therefore, in the process of cultivating computer talents, colleges and universities can improve students' programming ability and comprehensive ability by cultivating students' interest in competitions and encouraging students to participate in competitions.},

abstract={Engineering instructors often rely on lectures as their primary mode of instruction even in project courses. In the lecture mode of instruction student engagement with the course material is often low or non-existent until the date of an assessment activity (assignment or exam) is near. In passive learning environments students often do not get many opportunities to develop their soft skills. Many engineering educators regard experiential learning as a better way to train the next generation of software engineers to do project work. This paper describes the authors' experiences introducing active learning opportunities in a junior level software engineering course and a senior level game design course. The materials created for these courses were developed using a variation of the ADDIE (analyze, design, development, implementation, evaluation) process model. The team created a mix of case-study review, role play, trigger videos, and hands-on exercises involving work with software engineering artifacts or tools to facilitate coverage of the topics. The investigators collected observational data on student engagement while they were involved in various class activities and found that they were least engaged when listening to even short lectures. Student feedback and the authors' own lessons learned are being used to plan the next iterations of these courses.},

abstract={Can automated adaptive feedback for correcting erroneous programs help novice programmers learn to code better? In a large-scale experiment, we compare student performance when tutored by human tutors, and when receiving automated adaptive feedback. The automated feedback was designed using one of two well-known instructional principles: (i) presenting the correct solution for the immediate problem, or (ii) presenting generated examples or analogies that guide towards the correct solution. We report empirical results from a large-scale (N = 480,10,000+ person hour) experiment assessing the efficacy of these automated compilation-error feedback tools. Using the survival analysis on error rates of students measured over seven weeks, we found that automated feedback allows students to resolve errors in their code more efficiently than students receiving manual feedback. However, we also found that this advantage is primarily logistical and not conceptual; the performance benefit seen during lab assignments disappeared during exams wherein feedback of any kind was withdrawn. We further found that the performance advantage of automated feedback over human tutors increases with problem complexity, and that feedback via example and specific repair have distinct, non-overlapping relative advantages for different categories of programming errors. Our results offer a clear and granular delimitation of the pedagogical benefits of automated feedback in teaching programming to novices.},

abstract={Participation in Open Source Software (OSS) projects offers real software development experience for students and other newcomers seeking to develop their skills. However, onboarding to an OSS project brings various challenges, including finding a suitable task among various open issues. Selecting an appropriate starter task requires newcomers to identify the skills needed to solve a project issue and avoiding tasks too far from their skill set. However, little is known about how effective newcomers are in identifying the skills needed to resolve an issue. We asked 154 undergrad students to evaluate issues from OSS projects and infer the skills needed to contribute. Students reported a total of 94 skills, which we classified into 10 categories. We compared the students' answers to those collected from 6 professional developers. In general, students misidentified and missed several skills (f-measure=0.37). Students had results closer to professional developers for skills related to database, operating infrastructure, programming concepts, and programming language, and they had worse results in identifying skills related to debugging and program comprehension. Our results can help educators who seek to use OSS as part of their courses and OSS communities that want to label newcomer-friendly issues to facilitate onboarding of new contributors.},

abstract={Programming and software engineering differ by the aspect of time and scale. Going beyond just implementing software that fulfills requirements, software engineering also means writing code that can be maintained by multiple contributors over months, years or even decades. Due to the limited time of university projects, students mainly learn to focus on writing software that works once. In in-dustry, software lifetime is longer and the aspect of time becomes highly relevant. Professional software must be readable and modular to be maintainable. In this paper, we present an experience report on a novel university course in software engineering. The course teaches the concepts of unit testing, refactoring, and automation tools to novices with basic programming experience. We present those concepts for the example of C++,but they are applicable to any programming language. Our goal is to teach students the key con-cepts of software engineering early on, giving them the opportunity to benefit from these concepts in their further projects. We present these concepts in five plenary lectures with live coding sessions, and then student teams apply the concepts in five practical homework as-signments. All assignments contribute to a single project maintained and improved by the student groups for the duration of the course. Additionally, we present a teaching tool framework that can be used to automate tasks for student project management and examinations. Finally, we discuss the lessons learned from conducting this course for the first time. We believe this course is a valuable step towards including essential software engineering skills in the education of science and engineering students.},

Assessment focused on features delivered, rather than imposing responsibility for longer term `technical debt'. Academics acting as 'uncertain' customers were rejected as malevolent and implausible. Student teams composed of novices lacked the benefits of leadership provided by more experienced engineers. To address these shortcomings, real customers were introduced, exposing students to real requirements uncertainty. Flipped classroom teaching was adopted, giving teams one day each week to work on their project in a redesigned laboratory. Software process and quality were emphasised in the course assessment, imposing technical debt. Finally, we introduced a leadership course for senior students, who acted as mentors to the project team students. This paper reports on the experience of these changes, from the perspective of different stakeholders.},

abstract={Nowadays, many software projects are partially or completely open-source based. There is an increasing need for companies to participate in open-source software (OSS) projects, e.g., in order to benefit from open source ecosystems. OSS projects introduce particular challenges that have to be understood in order to gain the benefits. One such challenge is getting newcomers onboard into the projects effectively. Similar challenges may be present in other self-organised, virtual team environments. In this paper we present preliminary observations and results of in-progress research that studies the process of on boarding into virtual OSS teams. The study is based on a program created and conceived at Stanford University in conjunction with Facebook's Education Modernization program. It involves the collaboration of more than a dozen international universities and nine open source projects. More than 120 students participated in 2013. The students have been introduced to and supported by mentors experienced in the participating OSS projects. Our findings indicate that mentoring is an important factor for effective on boarding in OSS projects, promoting cohesion within distributed teams and maintaining an appropriate pace.},

abstract={Understanding how novices reason about coding at a neurological level has implications for training the next generation of software engineers. In recent years, medical imaging has been increasingly employed to investigate patterns of neural activity associated with coding activity. However, such studies have focused on advanced undergraduates and professionals. In a human study of 31 participants, we use functional near-infrared spectroscopy to measure the neural activity associated with introductory programming. In a controlled, contrast-based experiment, we relate brain activity when coding to that of reading natural language or mentally rotating objects (a spatial visualization task). Our primary result is that all three tasks-coding, prose reading, and mental rotation-are mentally distinct for novices. However, while those tasks are neurally distinct, we find more significant differences between prose and coding than between mental rotation and coding. Intriguingly, we generally find more activation in areas of the brain associated with spatial ability and task difficulty for novice coding compared to that reported in studies with more expert developers. Finally, in an exploratory analysis, we also find a neural activation pattern predictive of programming performance 11 weeks later. While preliminary, these findings both expand on previous results (e.g., relating expertise to a similarity between coding and prose reading) and also provide a new understanding of the cognitive processes underlying novice programming.},

abstract={Introduction: Although the interview is the most important and widely used requirements elicitation technique, novice engineers do not receive adequate training in Requirements Engineering (RE) courses. Objectives: Develop an AI-based interview simulator for helping novice requirements engineers in gaining interview skills. Methods: The research is based on the Design Science Methodology for Information Systems. The simulator is the outcome of six cycles; in each cycle, a proof of concept with additional features is created. Each cycle finishes with evaluation and improvement suggestions. Results: The simulator has been tested with students and results have been promising. The interview simulator understands context-free questions, retrieving the right information related to RE concepts such as goals, tasks, users, benefits, and constraints. The simulator also answers questions based on the context, makes summaries of the conversation, responds to meta-questions, and adds ambiguity and incompleteness to the conversation. Conclusions: The results have been promising. The simulator has been tested with degree and master level students. They were able to create a requirements specification using the simulator, and the feedback has been generally positive. The simulator will be tested in a real RE course in the academic year 2020-2021. Once it proves effective in the classroom, it will be opened to the RE community for free use and improvement.},

year={2020},

abstract={This paper explores the potential for new work-based apprenticeship degrees to encourage more women into computing degrees and the IT sector. In the UK, women are currently under-represented on computing courses. Meanwhile the IT industry requires more computing graduates, in general, and specifically more highly skilled women to create appropriate products and systems. The UK has recently introduced apprenticeship computing degrees, where the apprentice is a work-based employee. In some models, apprentices spend 20% of their time on Higher Education studies and also gain credits through work-based learning; in others, apprentices spend blocks of time in Higher Education and the workplace. These degrees offer a new and innovative route to studying computing at university. Largely funded by employers, apprentices are salaried, and their fees are paid, paving the way for more people to study for a degree. The work context enables apprentices to keep their jobs (if relevant) or to move into IT roles and start a computing degree without necessarily having computing qualifications; the degrees have no upper age limit. Extending the work-based approach of US cooperative education and student work placement models, apprenticeship degrees have been introduced to increase skills levels through a close partnership between universities and employers. This is particularly important in IT, where the sector is expanding, and employers are looking for both good technical and personal skills. With this model, employers are collaboratively involved in the design of the degrees and apprentices graduate with extensive work experience.We posed the following research question: Are there differences in the paths into computing apprenticeship degrees between women and men? A survey was conducted with apprentices beginning a degree in Fall 2019: Cyber Security, Data Science, IT Management for Business, or Software Engineering/Development. Participants were asked about their routes into the apprenticeship and the IT sector. Apprentices at five universities in Scotland and one in Northern Ireland completed the survey, on paper or online (n=85; 23 female, 59 male).The results revealed a less severe gender imbalance than with comparative on-campus degrees (28% female), but this varied greatly across the subjects, from Data Science, where 55% of respondents identified as female and IT Management for Business (40% female), to Software Development (27% female) and Cyber Security (only 11% female). Apprentices were more likely to have started the degree at least a few years after leaving school and this was especially true for women. More female respondents had also been with their current employer for over five years. However, women were slightly more likely to have joined their employers in order to start the apprenticeship.This initial work identifies opportunities to recruit women onto computing degree apprenticeships, for example by targeting women who have started careers. It also highlights that there are challenges in recruiting women into certain subject areas, especially Cyber Security, but also Software Development. Exploring our respondents' motivations for choosing their subjects illuminates the gender balance challenge and indicates how degree apprenticeships can encourage more women into the IT sector.},

abstract={Collaboration skills are important for future software engineers. In computer science education, these skills are of-ten practiced through group assignments, where students develop software collaboratively. The approach that students take in these assignments varies widely, but often involves a division of labour. It can then be argued whether collaboration still takes place. The discipline of computing education is especially interesting in this context, because some of its specific features (such as the variation in entry skill level and the use of source code repositories as collaboration platforms) are likely to influence the approach taken within groupwork. The aim of this research is to gain insight into the work division and allocation strategies applied by computer science students during group assignments. To this end, we interviewed twenty students of four universities. The thematic analysis shows that students tend to divide up the workload to enable working independently, with pair programming and code reviews being often employed. Motivated primarily by grade and efficiency factors, students choose and allocate tasks primarily based on their prior expertise and preferences. Based on our findings, we argue that the setup of group assignments can limit students' motivation for practicing new software engineering skills, and that interventions are needed towards encouraging experimentation and learning.},

Practitioners might get better prepared to the market expectations in lesser time, which could reduce training costs in the industry. In this paper we present an observational study aiming to allow a better understanding on how can communication and collaboration skills be improved by using Distributed Software Development (DSD). In the literature, we found previous researches that indicate a relationship between DSD and the improvement of skills. We use these researches as basis for our study. After a qualitative analysis of the data, we identified that, in the context of our experiment, the use of DSD in classroom accelerated the adoption of communication and collaboration practices and it can improve these skills.},

abstract={Software architecture is a relatively new software engineering discipline that has emerged as a response to the growing complexity of software systems and the problems these systems attempt to solve. Software is becoming the dominant component of most aerospace systems and it is necessary for the aerospace software development community to develop new practices, principles, and standards to manage this growing complexity. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) has developed and implemented a year-long educational program designed to develop expertise in software architectures and to train future software architects. Now in its third year, the software architect program (SWAP) selects senior software engineers and then apprentices them as software architects. The objective of this paper is to describe the structure of the SWAP, the program's background, how the program has evolved, and the lessons learned from the implementation of this educational program.},

abstract={Many programming language constructs that support software engineering in the large - explicit variable declarations, explicit external dependencies, static types, information hiding, invariants-provide little benefit to the small programs written by novice programmers, where every extra syntactic token has to be explained and understood before novices can succeed in running even the simplest program. We are designing Grace, a new educational object-oriented language that we hope will prove useful for teaching both programming and software engineering. This paper describes some of the tradeoffs between teaching programming and teaching software engineering that we faced while designing Grace, and our attempts to address those tradeoffs.},

abstract={IT-Security Tabletop Games for developers have been available in analog format; with the COVID-19 pandemic, interest in collaborative remote security games has increased. In this paper, we propose a methodology to evaluate the impact of a (remote) security game-based intervention on developers. The study design consists of the respective intervention, three questionnaires, and a small open interview guide for a focus group. A validated self-efficacy scale is used as a proxy for measuring effects on participants’ ability to develop secure software. We tested this design with 9 participants (expert and novice developers and security experts) as part of a small feasibility study to understand the challenges and limitations of remote tabletop games. We describe how we selected and digitalised three security tabletop games, and report the qualitative findings from our evaluation. Setting up and running the virtual tabletop games turned out to be more challenging and complex for both moderator and participants than we expected. Completing the games required patience and persistence, and social interaction was limited. Our findings can be helpful in building and evaluating a better, more comprehensive, technically sound and issue-specific game-based training measure for developers. The methodology can be used by researchers to evaluate existing and new game designs.},

abstract={It is difficult for teachers and graders to give an in-depth evaluation of student programs to the point of checking every line of code due to the amount of time checking would take. Solutions to this difficulty many involve only checking to see if the program executes correctly (dynamic analysis), glancing over the program to see if appropriate documentation to present (static analysis), and glancing over the code for any obvious problems (static analysis). A promising solution is to automate the assessment process or parts of it, however, automated solutions are difficult to construct and may be very expensive commercially. One commercial solution, however, is Verilog Logiscope which offers a limited number of licenses free to conductors. Logiscope is a static analysis checker which collects metrics on programs and allows the coverage of code to be determined when testing during program execution. It is also difficult to determine which metrics may be of use in the automated assessment of programs. This paper addresses this problem through using Logiscope to conduct a preliminary investigation with a small set of static metrics. Another metric, the code coverage of a set of test scripts run on all of the programs is also used. The metrics data collected from programs belonging to students in the beginning programming honors course, is presented and correlated to each other to determine their dependence on each order. Consideration on how to use the metrics to help students learn to program better is given.},

title={Effects of Developer Experience on Learning and Applying Unit Test-Driven Development},
year={2014},
volume={40},
number={4},
pages={381-395},
abstract={Unit test-driven development (UTDD) is a software development practice where unit test cases are specified iteratively and incrementally before production code. In the last years, researchers have conducted several studies within academia and industry on the effectiveness of this software development practice. They have investigated its utility as compared to other development techniques, focusing mainly on code quality and productivity. This quasi-experiment analyzes the influence of the developers' experience level on the ability to learn and apply UTDD. The ability to apply UTDD is measured in terms of process conformance and development time. From the research point of view, our goal is to evaluate how difficult is learning UTDD by professionals without any prior experience in this technique. From the industrial point of view, the goal is to evaluate the possibility of using this software development practice as an effective solution to take into account in real projects. Our results suggest that skilled developers are able to quickly learn the UTDD concepts and, after practicing them for a short while, become as effective in performing small programming tasks as compared to more traditional test-last development techniques. Junior programmers differ only in their ability to discover the best design, and this translates into a performance penalty since they need to revise their design choices more frequently than senior programmers.},

abstract={Software engineers learn through experience and training to optimize their software development process through a dynamic cycle of assessment, planning, enactment, and evaluation. When needed, software process improvement (SPI) frameworks (SPIFs) fill in experiential and educational gaps. However, because of the needs that drove their original development, existing SPIFs assume either a specific set of situational criteria or enough software engineering (SE) expertise to select and tailor SE best practices as needed. Outlier projects involving novice software developers or projects with unique concerns are left to find their own path to a quality software product. With such scenarios becoming more prevalent as computing becomes pervasive across society, there is a growing need for flexible, accessible SPIFs that allow decision-makers of all skill levels to efficiently self-drive their SPI efforts according to their individual goals and constraints. This paper outlines how we, as a research community, can and must meet this need by addressing the underlying theoretical, empirical, and practical challenges.},

We are targeting early courses in our curriculum, so that students internalize agile practices as part of their personal software development process. Our approach constitutes a cognitive apprenticeship that engages students in authentic software settings and articulates processes that are traditionally left implicit. Communication-intensive activities are woven through this curriculum in a variety of ways. The POGIL framework provides a structured approach to inquiry. Automated feedback on test coverage, programming style and code documentation are provided through WebTA, a novel tool that we have integrated into the Canvas learning management system, providing communication by proxy that supplements instructor feedback with continual critique of code and documentation. A program of guided inquiry through real case studies of software communication prepares students for their team software activities, and a series of reflective exercises leads them to focus on their own team communication practices.},

Although this system has been designed with end-users following a participatory process, the first version had also been found too rigid in regard to the roles management and to the underlying academic structures. In order to improve this TEL system, two approaches of re-engineering have been conducted. The first solution focuses on an internal modification of the system functionalities and parametrization facilities. The second re-engineering work follows a Domain-Specific Modeling approach that led us to propose a graphical editor communicating with the TEL system. This external component aims to provide end-users with a more user-friendly facility to configure booklets. This second work is particularly illustrated and discussed in regard to the promising underlying re-engineering process.},

abstract={Computer science education traditionally has stemmed from its mathematical roots and has been related to practice through instruction of programming languages. Good software engineering practice, in contrast, requires expertise at a complex of activities that involve the intellectual skills of planning, designing, evaluating, and revising. Cognitive research has revealed that developing intellectual skills, such as these, requires: explicit instruction and practice; in the context in which such skills will be applied; in carefully structured ways. We are applying the techniques of cognitive apprenticeship, situated cognition, and reflective practice, based on our earlier successful application of such techniques, to the development of laboratories to accompany two undergraduate classes. The first section of this paper provides the foundations from the computer science/software engineering domain that justify our effort. The second section provides the background in cognitive research we use to structure the learning environment and activities for the students. Section three provides an overview of the goals we have established as part of this development activity. Section four describes the activities we have implemented in the sophomore computer science course. We conclude our remarks with a discussion of problems and intended directions.},

abstract={The gap between industry needs and the skills of software engineering graduates is a well known problem. A common approach is to leave this problem for industry to resolve since they know best what skills they require of new employees. However, since many companies tend to have a shortage of resources, this may slow down or even hinder hiring of new graduates. Acclimatizing students to the working environment in industry presents a potential solution to ease the situation but it has received limited interest up to date. In the present paper a current practice survey on a regionally bound area is reported to establish a clear picture of the software development infrastructure used in the industry. This approach can be used to alleviate the acclimatization problem of students in two ways. First, the hard data gathered on the tools and technologies can be used to increase the understanding of software engineering practice among software engineering students and the community in general. Second, it demonstrates the role of regional aspects in current practice in industry. Aligning the infrastructure used in software engineering education with the current practice in industry could prove helpful in acclimatizing students to their future working environments and reduce the time and effort required for the development of a student to an industrial software engineer},

abstract={The use of Machine Learning (ML) classifiers to predict defective software modules are useful to help on planning software testing activities. Most of those studies use the accuracy as the main metric to evaluate the quality of the ML classifier. However, when unbalanced datasets are used to train and test the classifier, the ML model becomes biased. Biased ML models hide their real accuracy. In this context, this study proposes an approach to enhance the use of ML classifiers for predicting defective software modules even with unbalanced datasets. The results indicate: (1) a significant reduction on the number of false negatives; (2) a considerable gain on the efficacy of the software testing; (3) an increase of the number of modules correctly indicated as defective; however, there were also (4) an increase of the scope of the test suggested by the model; (5) a reduction of the software testing efficiency; (6) an increase of the number of the false positives; and (7) reduction of the overall accuracy. Therefore, the proposed approach imposes a trade-off to be considered when planning the software testing activities. Finally, this study also proposes an approach to help managers to deal with those trade-offs considering the resource constraints.},

abstract={Community-based Open Source Software (OSS) projects are usually self-organized and dynamic, receiving contributions from distributed volunteers. Newcomer are important to the survival, long-term success, and continuity of these communities. However, newcomers face many barriers when making their first contribution to an OSS project, leading in many cases to dropouts. Therefore, a major challenge for OSS projects is to provide ways to support newcomers during their first contribution. In this paper, we propose and evaluate FLOSScoach, a portal created to support newcomers to OSS projects. FLOSScoach was designed based on a conceptual model of barriers created in our previous work. To evaluate the portal, we conducted a study with 65 students, relying on qualitative data from diaries, self-efficacy questionnaires, and the Technology Acceptance Model. The results indicate that FLOSScoach played an important role in guiding newcomers and in lowering barriers related to the orientation and contribution process, whereas it was not effective in lowering technical barriers. We also found that FLOSScoach is useful, easy to use, and increased newcomers' confidence to contribute. Our results can help project maintainers on deciding the points that need more attention in order to help OSS project newcomers overcome entry barriers.},

abstract={Successful open source communities are constantly looking for new members and helping them become active developers. A common approach for developer onboarding in open source projects is to let newcomers focus on relevant yet easy-to-solve issues to familiarize themselves with the code and the community. The goal of this research is twofold. First, we aim at automatically identifying issues that newcomers can resolve by analyzing the history of resolved issues by simply using the title and description of issues. Second, we aim at automatically identifying issues, that can be resolved by newcomers who later become active developers. We mined the issue trackers of three large open source projects and extracted natural language features from the title and description of resolved issues. In a series of experiments, we optimized and compared the accuracy of four supervised classifiers to address our research goals. Random Forest, achieved up to 91% precision (F1-score 72%) towards the first goal while for the second goal, Decision Tree achieved a precision of 92% (F1-score 91%). A qualitative evaluation gave insights on what information in the issue description is helpful for newcomers. Our approach can be used to automatically identify, label, and recommend issues for newcomers in open source software projects based only on the text of the issues.},

abstract={Software engineering course plays an important role for overall development of new hires in corporate training. During last few years, both academia and industry turned their attention towards integrating soft-skills in learning, while efforts are being made to bridge the knowledge, skill gap between industry requirements and what academic institutes churn out. Learners appreciate the concepts when they experience the relevance of software engineering techniques to their day-to-day job work. Hence a scenario based learning approach is needed by integrating best practices with curriculum design, industry processes (hard factors); business communication and leadership skills (soft factors). In this work we address the top ten sought-after qualities from an entry level employee by imparting necessary knowledge and skills along with the soft factors. The most vital areas among the ones listed in Software Engineering Book Of Knowledge (SWEBOK) are taken for the course design and an outcome oriented pedagogy is proposed to enhance learning effectiveness. The pedagogical activities like learning by doing, learning from mistakes, team work, collaborative learning are suitably incorporated during execution of the course. The results based on the proposed model of execution are very promising towards enabling the entry level talent to be business ready.},

abstract={Last year we initiated a computer technology access fee. Next semester there will be a new "optional" fee in order that students can have easier access to the information superhighway. In addition, a significant tuition increase has been proposed, and high level administrators have discussed increasing the technology access fee. From the perspective of our high-level academic strategic planners, we have made great progress, and our pathway into the future is well defined. There is even much enthusiasm among many of our faculty members. By using software packages such as Matlab, DADisp, Orcad, and Pspice, students can perform meaningful tasks early in their engineering studies. But the situation encountered by students may nor be so rosy. The day-to-day support given to student computing facilities is not particularly good. Students may be required to hop from one software package to another without becoming competent in the use of any package, and may have little appreciation of the tasks they are performing. As engineering educators, we are faced with two major constraints. First, most of us agree that we are here to EDUCATE students rather than to train them. Secondly, we have recently experienced challenging job market opportunities. We would like our students to be able to successfully compete for technical jobs even when job opportunities are scarce. We are also aware that a significant number of employers, particularly small employers, would like entry level engineers to be prepared for productive work on the first day of a new job. Yet, different types of jobs require different skills, and we really do not know what technical skills will be required for engineers working in the 21st century.},

There are notable exceptions, but there are thousands of software projects slated for an under-six-month development cycle with perhaps a one or two year life cycle.This paper examines the nature of the changes and considers the implications. Industries with short development cycles and short life cycles, do not need to retain the project team for a long duration. The project team is largely composed of contractors; there are no pensions or training programs. In short cycle industries, professional credentials such as association memberships, relationships and networks are important; agents play an integral role, and apprenticeships or training are undertaken by individuals rather than provided by corporations. Trust and reputation play a far greater role, allowing for confidence in a changing set of roles. The implications for the software industry include significant organizational restructuring, "benefits" such as retirement and health insurance associated with something other than the "employer," a modern version of guilds, availability of training and credentialing, an increase in collaborative innovation associated with fluid project teams, and a significantly increased role for agents. This paper considers some of the lessons and best practices from industries with short development cycles and short life cycles, and examines the implications for the software industry.},

abstract={Knowledge, skill and attitude are three necessary ingredients for the success of fresh graduates both in terms of learning and employability. It is important to identify suitable teaching methodology to impart transferable skills to the participants. Outcome based curricula and experiential learning pedagogies create positive influence among participants towards learning. In this paper, Java web development course is considered describing course level outcomes connected with company's entry level program level outcomes. Case studies are used as assessment instruments towards measuring the abilities of the participants aligned with expected skills from entry level developers specific to Java Technology stream. Two approaches are discussed where the first approach uses normal class room delivery and the second approach just-in-time and scenario based approach. In the former one the software engineering and java concepts are covered as factual knowledge components where as in the second approach, an attempt is made to integrate process knowledge components from software engineering together with Java technology concepts using business scenario as a vehicle. The performance of the participants with respect to their case study deliverables is compared with two approaches. These results highlight importance of an integrated approach towards curriculum design and adopting appropriate teaching, assessment instruments towards imparting technical skills.},

abstract={Summary form only given. Engineers and other knowledge workers must continually learn both to stay abreast of current technology and to advance in their careers. Their total set of competencies and skills represents the value they bring to the firm. Expertise becomes the currency by which their worth is measured. Much of their learning must happen in a "job-specific" setting where they apply conceptual knowledge to mastery of the tools used in pursuit of their work objectives and deliverables. Content experts have the duty and responsibility to deploy knowledge to all who need it in the organization. They must teach the rest of us to use the knowledge that they possess. If an engineer writes a new specification, develops a new process or invents a new software tool, the job is not finished until the users know how to apply it. The deployment happens via knowledge transfer which is the broadest definition of training. In our lives and work, we both teach and learn and so it is for engineers as well. As novices, we may do move learning than teaching, but even with experience, we can never stop learning, we simply have to teach more. The solution to this seeming work load dilemma is to learn and grow through teaching. These are some of the fundamental precepts of the "Learning Organization". We illustrate how these concepts are being practiced in the high technology industry and how "knowledge products" are deployed through training. We also demonstrate with cases and methods how engineers can and must become successful teachers in order to do their jobs.},

abstract={Maintaining an educated, high-performance workforce in the today's world of fast changing technology is a daunting task, especially in the electro-mechanical and mechatronics field. Traditional practice in the enterprises is to provide training/retraining to their employees by means of the conventional in-company training. Such training usually doesn't use the advantages of the communications technology and distance learning and doesn't accommodate different learning styles and individual needs of the practicing engineers and technicians. E-PRAGMATIC network (E-Learning and Practical Training of Mechatronics and Alternative Technologies in Industrial Community) unites 17 partners from seven European countries in a common effort to modernize mechatronics vocational training of the professionals, apprentices and trainees. Modern educational approaches and distance learning modules with remote access to the working stations will be integrated in the in-company training of network's industrial partners. The training will be prepared by the educational partners and carefully balanced to meet the concrete needs of the enterprises. Based on the experience, the education methods for organizing and executing in-company training on distance will be developed. This contribution presents the network and the results of the extensive empirical knowledge and skills needs study of the professionals employed in the E-PRAGMATIC network's industrial members. Based on the study's results, about 20 learning modules will be implemented. As an example, two E-PRAGMATIC modules are described: (1) Engineering software: Introduction to LabVIEW, (2) Data acquisition and signal processing module.},

abstract={Computer programming subject is a core ingredient for most of the engineering disciplines. However for the first year engineering, teaching and learning fundamentals of programming language like C has been considered as a great challenge to both teachers and novice learners. The challenges in learning the programming languages are: the learners are not able to analyze the flow of program, cannot fix errors or not able to debug the program, usually dependent on others for problem solving, bug fixing. Programming skills and documentation are the most important aspects of software development. The structure of C program with proper indentation, comments & proper named variables can reduce most of the general compiler errors. The study proposes a novice way of teaching C language programming with effective program writing skills for the beginners. The experiment is conducted for the First year Civil engineering students and the course is Computer Programming based on C language. A training session on effective program writing skills is conducted, to improve the ability of program writing skills with minimized compiler errors for novice learners. The effect of the experiment is verified with Pretest & Posttest before and after the training session. It is observed that the program written with proper indentation, comments and proper named variable can reduce the number of compiler errors and more than 60% of the student have written & executed the given C programs successfully in a stipulated time.},

abstract={During the Formulation phases of the NASA Project Life Cycle, communication systems engineers are responsible for designing space communication links and analyzing their performance to ensure that the proposed communication architecture is capable of satisfying high-level mission requirements. Senior engineers with extensive experience in communications systems perform these activities. However, the increasing complexity of space systems coupled with the current shortage of communications systems engineers has led to an urgent need for expedited training of new systems engineers. A pilot program, in which college-bound high school and undergraduate students studying various engineering disciplines are immersed in NASA's systems engineering practices, was conceived out of this need. This rapid summerlong training approach is feasible because of the availability of advanced software and technology tools and the students' inherent ability to operate such tools. During this pilot internship program, a team of college-level and recently-hired engineers configured and utilized various software applications in the design and analysis of communication links for a plausible lunar sortie mission. The approach taken was to first design the direct-to-Earth communication links for the lunar mission elements, then to design the links between lunar surface and lunar orbital elements. Based on the data obtained from these software applications, an integrated communication system design was realized and the students gained valuable systems engineering knowledge. This paper describes this approach to rapidly training college-bound high school and undergraduate engineering students from various disciplines in NASA's systems engineering practices and tools. A summary of the potential use of NASA's emerging systems engineering internship program in broader applications is also described.},

year={2020},
volume={},
number={},
pages={886-898},
abstract={As Android platform evolves in a fast pace, API-related compatibility issues become a significant challenge for developers. To handle an incompatible API invocation, developers mainly have two choices: merely performing sufficient checks to avoid invoking incompatible APIs on platforms that do not support them, or gracefully providing replacement implementations on those incompatible platforms. As providing more consistent app behaviors, the latter one is more recommended and more challenging to adopt. However, it is still unknown how these issues are handled in the real world, do developers meet difficulties and what can we do to help them. In light of this, this paper performs the first large-scale study on the current practice of handling evolution-induced API compatibility issues in about 300,000 Android market apps, and more importantly, their solutions (if exist). Actually, it is in general very challenging to determine if developers have put in countermeasure for a compatibility issue, as different APIs have diverse behaviors, rendering various repair. To facilitate a large-scale study, this paper proposes RAPID, an automated tool to determine whether a compatibility issue has been addressed or not, by incorporating both static analysis and machine learning techniques. Results show that our trained classifier is quite effective by achieving a F1-score of 95.21% and 91.96% in the training stage and the validation stage respectively. With the help of RAPID, our study yields many interesting findings, e.g. developers are not willing to provide alternative implementations when handling incompatible API invocations (only 38.4%); for those incompatible APIs that Google gives replacement recommendations, the ratio of providing alternative implementations is significantly higher than those without recommendations; developers find more ways to repair compatibility issues than Google's recommendations and the knowledge acquired from these experienced developers would be extremely useful to novice developers and may significantly improve the current status of compatibility issue handling.},

abstract={The Robot Operating System (ROS) was initially introduced to lower the barriers to robots software development by reducing the need for extensive domain knowledge. ROS allows developers to build valuable robots by configuring and reusing off-the-shelf components while writing little, if any, code through its modular design, loosely coupled architecture, and rich package ecosystem. However, despite the advantages of this approach, the lack of documentation can present a challenge to novice users. In this work, we discuss the challenges and experience of learning and using ROS from the perspective of three novice users with little to no prior experience in robotics. We report on the experiences in learning ROS through a popular commercial training course provided by The Construct Sim. Through our analysis, we identify several common misunderstandings, mistakes, and bugs, and we outline possible improvements to ROS to overcome these challenges. Our findings motivate further studies on the development of robotic systems in ROS by novice users and promote the improvement of the ROS ecosystem, on educational and training materials of ROS, and on tooling development to help novices identify and correct simple mistakes.},

abstract={Software design patterns are solutions to common software problems that are proven to work adequately in particular scenarios. Deciding which design pattern to use for a given software problem often requires practical knowledge acquired with experience in a similar domain and can be highly subjective and error-prone. Further, for novice programmers, an automated approach would be of tremendous help as it would provide practical knowledge required for deciding which design pattern to use for a particular software problem. The majority of research in software design pattern prediction involves using software structure and features in determining which design pattern to implement. However, there are circumstances where software engineers would prefer to know which design pattern to be used by looking at the design problem during or before the implementation phase. Existing design pattern prediction tools cannot be utilized in this scenario due to the absence of code and class structures. To address this issue, this paper proposes a new approach that analyzes the context of the software problem from text and predicts a suitable design pattern for the given problem context using feature learning, neural embedding, and classification. We evaluate our approach on a case study from Stack Overflow with more than 66,000 questions that discuss problems and consequences related to 23 design patterns. Results show that our approach can predict design patterns from the text with 82% overall accuracy.},

title={Identifying Code Smells with Collaborative Practices: A Controlled Experiment},
year={2016},
volume={},
number={},
pages={61-70},
abstract={Code smells are often considered as key indicators of software quality degradation. If code smells are not systematically removed from a program, its continuous degradation may lead to either major maintenance effort or the complete redesign of the system. For several reasons, software developers introduce smells in their code as soon as they start to learn programming. If novice developers are ought to become either proficient programmers or skilled code reviewers, they should be early prepared to effectively identify code smells in existing programs. However, effective identification of code smells is often not a non-trivial task in particular to a novice developer working in isolation. Thus, the use of collaborative practices may have the potential to support developers in improving their effectiveness on this task at their early stages of their careers. These practices offer the opportunity for two or more developers analyzing the source code together and collaboratively reason about potential smells prevailing on it. Pair Programming (PP) and Coding Dojo Randori (CDR) are two increasingly adopted practices for improving the effectiveness of developers with limited or no knowledge in software engineering tasks, including code review tasks. However, there is no broad understanding about the impact of these collaborative practices on the effectiveness of code smell identification. This paper presents a controlled experiment involving 28 novice developers, aimed at assessing the effectiveness of collaborative practices in the identification of code smells. We compared PP and CDR with solo programming in order to better distinguish their impact on the effective identification of code smells. Our study is also the first in the literature to observe how novice developers work individually and together to identify smells. Our results suggest that collaborative practices contribute to the effectiveness on the identification of a wide range of code smells. Our findings can also be used in practice to guide educators, researchers or teams on improving detection and training on code smell identification.},

In this center, graduate and undergraduate students from engineering and business colleges work as interns on product and process development projects contracted with industrial partners. To each project contracted with client companies, an interdisciplinary group of interns is assigned to work under the supervision of an experienced staff member and deliver new designs, prototypes and manufacturing processes. This operation provides a unique and innovative active learning environment for junior and senior students from several engineering disciplines. Students learn to perform as members of an interdisciplinary team, develop outstanding communication skills (because they have to sell their ideas to a paying customer), and realize the business side of engineering activities. The paper presents the detailed results of the operation of ELC since its inception in 1995. It also details the lessons learned in establishing and operating this center with a guide for things to emphasize and pitfalls to avoid.},

abstract={Unfair work distribution in student teams is a common issue in project-based learning. One contributing factor is that students are differently skilled developers. In a course with group work intertwining engineering and business aspects, we designed an intervention to help novice programmers, i.e., we introduced mandatory programming lab sessions. However, the intervention did not affect the work distribution, showing that more is needed to balance the workload. Contrary to our goal, the intervention was very well received among experienced students, but unpopular with students weak at programming.},

abstract={Open Source Software (OSS) projects leverage the contribution of outsiders. In fact, the sustainability of many projects relies on retaining some of these newcomers. Usually these communities do not coordinate the work of the newcomers, who go to the issue trackers and self-select a task to start with. We found that "finding a way to start" was reported as an important issue by practitioners. To further investigate this specific barrier, we conducted a qualitative analysis with data obtained from semi-structured interviews with 36 subjects from 14 different projects, including newcomers and experienced members. We used procedures of Grounded Theory -- open and axial coding -- to analyze the data. We found that newcomers are not confident enough to choose their initial task and they need information about the tasks or direction from the community to support choosing a task more suitable for them. We also present a set of strategies identified in the literature, interviews, and state-of-the-practice that can provide newcomers with such information, enabling them to be more confident when choosing their first tasks and collaborate with the community.},

pages={138-149},
abstract={Software designers and developers are increasingly relying on application frameworks as first-class design concepts. They instantiate the services that frameworks provide to implement various architectural tactics and patterns. One of the challenges in employing frameworks for such tasks is the difficulty of learning and correctly using the APIs of the frameworks. This paper introduces a learning-based approach called ARCODE to help novice programmers correctly use frameworks’ APIs to implement architectural tactics and patterns. ARCODE has several novel components: a graph-based approach for learning specification of a framework from a limited number of training software, a program analysis algorithm to eliminate erroneous training data, and a recommender module to help programmers use APIs correctly and identify API misuses in their program. We evaluated our technique across two popular frameworks: JAAS security framework used for authentication and authorization tactic and Java RMI framework used to enable remote method invocation between client and server and other object oriented patterns. Our results demonstrate (i) the feasibility of using ARCODE to learn the specification of a framework; (ii) ARCODE generates accurate recommendations for finding the next API call to implement an architectural tactic/pattern based on the context of the programmer’s code; (iii) it accurately detects API misuses in the code that implements a tactic/pattern and provides fix recommendations. We also demonstrate that ArCode outperforms two famous techniques, MAPO and GrouMiner, on API recommendation and misuse detection tasks.},

title={Evaluation of a UML-Based Versus an IEC 61131-3-Based Software Engineering Approach for Teaching PLC Programming},
year={2013},
volume={56},
number={3},
pages={329-335},
abstract={A field experiment investigated the evaluation, teaching, and application of two different approaches to automatic control in programmable logic controllers, in particular comparing the Unified Modeling Language (UML) to the classic procedural paradigm (IEC 61131-3). A total of 85 apprentices from a vocational school for production engineering with a specialization in mechatronics took part in the training and the experiment. This paper details the results of the training using both approaches, and the correlations found between the modeling and/or programming performance and cognitive abilities, interest, workload, expertise, and school grades. In general, the results show that students can be trained to carry out authentic programming tasks within one and a half days, even for beginners in programming. The data distinguish the two approaches. Function Block Diagram programming (IEC 61131-3) can be best predicted by the grade in mathematics, programming experience, and cognitive demand. For performance in UML class diagram and state chart (UML/CD+SC) modeling, the grade in mathematics plays an even more prominent role; this explains the greater variance in modeling performance in the UML group than in the 61131/Function Block Diagram group. With respect to other findings, the paper concludes that special problem-solving skills and skills for abstract thinking should be taught when teaching UML-based modeling approaches.},

abstract={The apprenticeship in the dual system of Vocational Education and Training (VET) in Germany takes place at companies with training departments and vocational schools. For the needs of requirements analysis for workplace-integrated mobile learning designs and the development of a context-sensitive mobile application in those companies we interviewed apprentices from mechanical engineering. Based on a theoretically derived comprehensive catalog of software features, we determined the most used software features by apprentices in the past and those, which are mostly requested by them for the intended application in VET. This includes learning with a diversity of multimedia formats, the support of action-oriented tasks, videos explaining work processes, digital mechanical engineering learning contents, and a cloud system to store and share data. We identified the main tasks of apprentices in mechanical engineering education. These are related to action-oriented work orders, typically composed of analyzing mechanical drawings, planning the work process, milling or turning workpieces and a final quality control. The respective educational characteristics of these learning phases are suitable to be supported by digital media. Though well-used in the private context of the apprentices, in the area of mobile learning in VET and with regard to the educational use of smartphones and tablet computers those devices are currently less utilized in the learning environments of training companies and vocational schools. The results of this survey will be considered for the design of workplace-integrated mobile learning as well as for the development of a mobile application for respective learning scenarios. The focus of the underlying instructional design is on an integrated view of existing work processes, assisting educational materials, and social processes in VET.},

abstract={The world is abound with data. Almost every organization has utilized a Database Management System (DBMS) to store and manage the huge amount of data. Problem exists when the ability to leverage the features of the tools has historically fallen to a limited group of experts. This would require formal database design training and cannot be learnt overnight. As such, the problem leads to another issue which is, developers avoidance of using DBMS for their data storage. Thus, the objective of this work is to provide a way for tackling the issue by developing a tool for users who have less experiences and understanding in database design to be able to develop their own database schema. The tool will provide guidance to the developers in a story-telling fashion. The methodology used in developing the tool is design thinking and rapid application development (RAD). Initial user acceptance test conducted with few representatives of the target group gives promising results in terms of usefulness, user-friendliness, ease of time and user satisfaction of the tool.},

Higher cognition levels were observed when using inspection techniques that utilise a more structured reading process. This result highlights the importance of introducing novice programmers to structured code reading strategies. Findings suggest that teaching different software inspection techniques throughout software courses, beginning with structured techniques, is an excellent way to build a studentpsilas critical software reading and analysis skills.},

abstract={Engineering instructors often rely on lectures as their primary mode of instruction even in project courses. In the lecture mode of instruction student engagement with the course material is often low or non-existent. Many engineering educators regard experiential learning as the best way to train the next generation of software engineers. For the past five years, one of the authors has taught a junior level software engineering course using active learning methods in a flipped classroom setting. During this past year, the COVID-19 lockdown prevented in-person delivery of this course. The challenge facing engineering faculty everywhere is figuring out how to include active learning experiences in online course delivery. This paper describes the authors' experiences introducing active learning methodologies into a junior level online software engineering course. The project team carefully considered the active learning course materials used in the in-person delivery of this course and adapted them to accommodate the idiosyncrasies of an online course delivery environment. Most importantly, a comparable online course delivery alternative needed to include zoom video class sessions containing live active learning exercises. The investigators compared the levels of student engagement between previous in-person offerings of the course with the online adaptation of the same course. Student engagement data was collected from each style of course delivery. In some cases, this data was supplemented by observational data and with Canvas course analytics. We found that students in both course settings were least engaged when listening to short lectures (either live or video recordings) and felt most engaged when involved in small group activities (either in person or in Zoom sessions with breakout rooms).},

abstract={WebIDE is a new web-based development environment for entry-level programmers with two primary goals: minimize tool barriers to writing computer programs and introduce software engineering best practices early in a student's educational career. Currently, WebIDE focuses on Test-Driven Learning (TDL) by using small iterative examples and introducing lock-step labs, which prevent the student from moving forward until they finish the current step. However, WebIDE does not require that labs follow TDL. Instructors can write their own labs for WebIDE using any software engineering or pedagogical approach. Likewise, instructors can build custom evaluators - written in any language - to support their approach and provide detailed error messages to students. We report on a pilot study in a CS0 course where students were split into two groups, one that used WebIDE and one that didn't. The WebIDE group showed a significant improvement in performance when writing a simple Android application. Additionally, among students with some programming experience, the WebIDE group was more proficient in writing unit tests.},

abstract={We focus on developer code review performance, and analyze whether the age of a subject affects the efficiency and preciseness of their code. Generally, older coders have more experience. Therefore, the age is considered to positively affect code review. However, in our past study, code understanding speed was relatively slow for older subjects, and memory is needed to understand programs. Similarly, during code review, a subject's age may affect efficiency (e.g., the number of indications per unit time). In the experiment, subjects reviewed source code, referring to mini specification documents. When the code did not follow the document, the subjects indicated the error. We classified subjects into senior and junior groups. In the analysis, we stratified the results based on age, and used correlation coefficients and multiple linear regression to clarify the relationship between age and review performance. We found that age does not affect the efficiency and correctness of code review. Also, the software development experience of subjects is not significantly correlated to performance.},

In some of these environments, the complex and changing nature of operational requirements is exacerbated by the cost of training and need to meet certification requirements. A case-based intelligent tutoring system (CBITS) has been proposed as one alternative to respond to the need for additional training. This paper describes the development of cases for a case-based intelligent tutor and illustrates how an example case can be used in a particular implementation-GT-CBITS (Georgia Tech case-based intelligent tutoring system). The case addresses the use of a newly certified submode and control feature of the MD-11 aircraft. The paper illustrates how GT-CBITS represents expert knowledge of a case with the operator function model (OFM) and uses OFMspert, the computational implementation of the operator function model, as the intelligence to maintain dynamic expert and student models.},

The grounding system is evaluated with six different cases. Different parameter is changed in each case to observe the result of the grounding system. The result shows that there are several important parameters in designing a grounding system. The parameters are grounding grid size, number of parallel rod, level of fault current, crush rock layer, cross sectional area of ground rod and level of soil resistivity. The tolerable and calculated step and touch voltage as well as the mesh voltage of the grounding system are presented in manner to tutor novice professionals on AC grounding system design. Last but not least the software developed in the laboratory useful for novice professionals training for AC substation grounding system.},

year={2019},
volume={},
number={},
pages={84-94},
abstract={Novices' functionally-correct code is often redundant, verbose, or un-idiomatic. Such code could indicate shallow understanding of the programming language, or unfamiliarity with experts' preferences for code structure. Understanding why novices write poorly is important for designing instruction and tools to help novices write elegantly. 231 novices judged style and readability for sets of code snippets targeting seven topics. Within each set, functionality was the same, but the writing followed either common novice patterns or a more elegant, "expert" pattern. Overall, 76% of novices thought the "expert" snippets had the best style, but only 64% said those snippets were most readable. However, comprehension was similar for both "expert" and novice patterns, regardless of readability preferences. This suggests that students who prefer novice patterns do not necessarily have deep misunderstandings about the programming language. One topic included a code-writing task, and students' readability preferences were predictive of their code-writing patterns, suggesting that readability preferences reflect writing choices rather than comprehension. Thus, novices may benefit from lightweight tools that identify common patterns and suggest an "expert" solution, while helping them see that the "expert" solution is more readable than they think.},

We need a more effective and active programming training environment to catch the fast pace of the new technology's progress.

Each stage emphasizes a different kind of programming technique training. The existing MPTE is such a programming training environment whose goals fall into the first stage, namely, the entry-level programmer. In order to efficiently train an entry-level programmer to become a skilled one, we have designed a new training environment called NMPTE, through which we hope that skilled programmers can effectively and massively be produced. The salient features of this system are that: it is based on the learner-centered model, and the instructor will be able to "actively" involve in the learner's learning process; and the learners' error programs are valuable training resources, they will be collected by the system and added to course content.},

A model based on reflective practice, founded on the evaluation of previous cycles applying Cognitive Apprenticeship and Problem-based Learning, was developed and implemented. This study looked at the alignment between student approaches to learning and the environment developed, in particular student disposition towards deep or surface learning. Although evaluation shows the student cohort achieved significantly higher scores in their assessment that those of previous offerings, it was notable that students who reported themselves as adopting surface approaches were less comfortable with the environment. However, they still exhibited deep learning characteristics when observed in a subsequent course. While an understanding of student learning is fundamental in developing learning environments, alignment between discipline and learning is also critical in educating competent practitioners. Results of this study show that students placed in an environment that enables them to model professional practice, and reflect on that modelling, should be much better prepared for the workplace.},

abstract={Educational game design environments are used for teaching computational thinking and software engineering concepts to novices. In software engineering education, there has recently been calls for "innovative methods for software teaching and training in online courses" (http://2014.icse-conferences.org/seet). However, to date, learning these concepts is tied to a formal learning environment and the presence of a teacher. In line with the new educational opportunities provided by the Web such as massive open online courses (MOOCs) and e-learning 2.0 platforms, we have created an online educational game design environment with integrated learning resources including video tutorials, showcases, and communication tools. To understand the effect of online educational game design environments with integrated support for learning on novices' use of the system and their learning, we conducted a mixed-method study with nine participants. While the learning goals were achieved to a high degree, the analysis of participants' interaction with the system reveals interesting phenomena about user preferences, such as the fact that during the given computational thinking tasks, the participants preferred the synchronous communication channel to other forms of commonly provided learning resources such as forums.},

abstract={Clinical training is one of the most challenging areas for education especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. There are limited access to apprenticeship training in the complex scenarios with corresponding difficulty training in a time-effective manner. Our work on intelligent clinical training systems provides one effective solution to this problem by introducing intelligent clinical training systems that can supplement tutoring sessions by expert clinical instructors. The Bayesian representation techniques and algorithms for generating tutoring feedback in medical problem-based learning group problem solving made important contributions to the field of Intelligent Tutoring Systems. In particular, it was one of the first systems for tutoring groups of students and the first intelligent tutoring systems for medical problem-based learning. The virtual reality simulator we developed is one of the most sophisticated dental simulators. It stands out as the first dental simulator to integrate sophisticated analysis of the surgical procedure. Particularly noteworthy is also the creative way to understand important issues such as differences in expert and novice performance, the effectiveness of virtual pre-operative practice, and the teaching effectiveness of the simulator. The systems have been implemented in undergrad pre-clinical training and postgrad pre-surgical training with strong scientific evidence of their effectiveness.},

abstract={Conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) is difficult and time-consuming for an experienced researcher, and even more so for a novice graduate student. With a better understanding of the most common difficulties in the SLR process, mentors will be better prepared to guide novices through the process. This understanding will help researchers have more realistic expectations of the SLR process and will help mentors guide novices through its planning, execution, and documentation phases. Consequently, the objectives of this work are to identify the most difficult and time-consuming phases of the SLR process. Using data from two sources - 52 responses to an online survey sent to all authors of SLRs published in software engineering venues and qualitative experience reports from 8 PhD students who conducted SLRs as part of a course - we identified specific difficulties related to each phase of the SLR process. Our findings highlight the importance of planning, teamwork, and mentoring by an experienced researcher throughout the process. The paper also identifies implications for the teaching of the SLR process.},

year={2013},
volume={},
number={},
pages={70-79},
abstract={While modularity is highly regarded as an important quality of software, it poses an educational dilemma: the true value of modularity is realized only as software evolves, but student homework, assignments and labs, once completed, seldom evolve. In addition, students seldom receive feedback regarding the modularity and evolvability of their designs. Prior work has shown that it is extremely easy for students and junior developers to introduce extra dependencies in their programs. In this paper, we report on a first experiment applying a tool-supported architecture review process in a software design class. To scientifically address this education problem, our first objective is to advance our understanding of why students make these modularity mistakes, and how the mistakes can be corrected. We propose tool-guided architecture review so that modularity problems in students' implementation can be revealed and their consequences can be assessed against possible change scenarios. Our pilot study shows that even students who understand the importance of modularity and have excellent programming skills may introduce additional harmful dependencies in their implementations. Furthermore, it is hard for them to detect the existence of these dependencies on their own. Our pilot study also showed that students need more formal training in architectural review to effectively detect and analyze these problems.},

abstract={Access to haptic technology is on the rise, in smartphones, virtual reality gear, and open-source education kits. However, engineers and interaction designers are often inexperienced in designing with haptics, and rarely have tools and guidelines for creating multisensory experiences. To examine the impact of this deficit, we supplied a haptic design kit, custom software, and technical support to nine teams (25 students) for an innovation challenge at a major haptics conference. Teams (predominantly undergraduate engineers with little haptics, interaction design, or education training) designed and built haptic environments to support learning of science topics. Qualitative analysis of surveys, interviews, team blogs, and expert assessments of teams' final demonstrations exposed three themes in these design efforts. 1) Novice teams tended to ignore many of ten design choices that experts navigate, such as explicitly choosing whether haptic and graphic feedback should reinforce versus complement one other. 2) Their design activities differed in timing and inclusion from the ten activities observed in expert process. 3) We identified three success strategies in how teams devised useful and engaging interactions and interpretable multimodal experiences, and communicated about their designs. We compare novice and expert design needs and highlight where future haptic design tools and theory need to support novice practice and training.},

abstract={The benefits of using design patterns have been widely acknowledged by experienced software professionals. The application of design patterns to object-oriented software development has already brought positive results in practice. Reported benefits include significant increases in quality and productivity. However, using design patterns is not a trivial process especially for students and novice designers/programmers. This paper introduces a tool for teaching design patterns to students and novice designers/programmers in order to teach those recognizing appropriate patterns and applying them properly. It provides an interactive environment that is designed as if the users requested the information in multiple stages. Each stage adds additional features that were not included in the previous stage. The help supporting each stage guarantees that the user can understand the current stage and help him moving to the next stage. The tool provides a real life existence for each pattern selected that illustrates the application of that pattern in software development.},

abstract={The unemployment rate in South Africa for first quarter 2017 was just under thirty percent. To help alleviate this problem, the South African Revenue Service offers certain tax incentives to companies which operate internships or in-service training to under-skilled individuals. At the same time of this high unemployment rate, there is a shortage of certain IT skills in the country including a shortage of Java programmers. This paper describes research in offering internships to people who hold some sort of documented proof of computer literacy such as the ICDL and training them to write test automation programs in Java. The internship creates a pathway from test automation to entry level Java programmer. This paper describes two iterations of the process and documents the training offered to the interns, the successes and the lessons learned. In the second iteration (and the final iteration described in this paper), interns learned Java programming by writing test program in Java using Sikulix (to test Java application), Selenium (to test websites) and Robotium (to test Android apps). The results are very positive.},

abstract={Educational software can be a valuable tool for teaching and learning at the pre-college level, where the foundation is laid for entry into technology-related fields like computer science and engineering. Like all technology, the promise of educational software to advance learning and spark career interest in these areas also comes with the potential for unintended and unwanted consequences. One of these consequences is gendered outcomes in learning and career interest. Oversight of gender issues in the design and application of educational software, as well as the way it used by teachers in the classroom, can result in technology-based educational experiences that are more appealing to boys than girls, and that ultimately reinforce the gender imbalance in science and technology majors. As a first step toward understanding how educational software design and teacher implementation can achieve and promote gender balance, this paper brings together research from education, sociology, psychology, and computing to explore the interaction between gender and technology education},

abstract={Since the 19th century, historians and archaeologists have compiled transliterations and translations of surviving cuneiform texts from the Middle East area, documenting the ancient history of the region, c. 3000 BC–75 AD. The Open Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus (Oracc)1 is an international collaborative effort to gather and digitise a complete collection of cuneiform texts and their translations, with the goal of making them available to researchers and students worldwide. Oracc was developed ten years ago around the core value of ensuring accessibility to a broad audience, rather than a select group of experts. This principle presented new technological challenges, but has equally offered important benefits. Initial transliteration of cuneiform tablets into the ASCII Transliteration Format (ATF) was performed using an Emacs plugin, the use of which was challenging for novice and experienced users alike. This precipitated the development of Nammu [1], a dedicated editor for files written in ATF, to provide a consistent environment for users to contribute to Oracc projects. This is an important step in the democratization of this research as it lowers the technological expertise required to join the platform, and reduces the amount of time needed to train new users, which was previously a large drain on Principal Investigators’ time and resources. Nammu in turn takes advantage of pyORACC [2], a bespoke library developed for parsing ATF files and a key enabler of automation in the project. Separately to the editing considerations, the Oracc website hosts the body of information editions and translations that researchers from different groups have accumulated during their work. An important aspect of this is the search capability it offers, allowing a user to retrieve information about a subject or term of their choice. A new version of this functionality is being developed, using the ElasticSearch platform to index and efficiently search large bodies of text. Users can choose to query the compiled glossaries, looking for words with a particular meaning, or for the meaning and appearances of a transliterated cuneiform term. Alternatively, they will be able to search through the information pages for a topic of their choice, effectively using the website as a domain-specific search engine. This dual functionality has been chosen so as to make the search of interest to both domain experts and the general public. Early versions of Nammu focused on the transliteration and translation of cuneiform into English and other European languages. Meanwhile, decades of war and political instability across the Middle East have prevented researchers from Iraq, Syria and neighbouring countries from contributing to the ancient history Programming work on Oracc is funded by UCL’s School of Social and Historical Sciences, and through the Nahrein Network’s grant from the UK Arts and Humanities Council’s Global Challenges Research Fund. 1http://oracc.org of their region, and excluded local communities from benefiting socially, economically or intellectually from that research. To address this pressing issue, the latest developments of Nammu have focused on the introduction of support for right to left languages such as Arabic, Kurdish and Farsi. This has required the redesign of the software to allow the interleaving of the left-to-right ATF transliterations and right-to-left language translations. Similarly, the new website search is being developed with an international audience in mind, particularly from the Middle East. These concerns are central to the Nahrein Network2, which is driving the next step in Oracc’s development. The Network’s core mission is to foster the sustainable development of history, heritage and the humanities in post-conflict Iraq and its neighbours through collaborative, capacity-building research. Naturally, this involves establishing a dialogue with local scholarly communities in order to identify requirements particular to the region (such as the means of accessing digital content and any related challenges). These are then taken into account in all aspects, including software development. The digital outputs of Oracc play a crucial role in the Nahrein Network’s effort, by enabling access to data and tools for communities internationally. Work on the project involves professional software developers with scientific experience (Research Software Engineers) collaborating with academics from the domain. This collaboration grew organically as the scale of the project increased beyond what the original contributors could support, making the need for automation and more sophisticated technical solutions clearer. This practice continues to the present, with academics describing what features are required, advising on future developments, and being informed by the developers on their technological choices, while also providing domain knowledge when deeper comprehension is required or beneficial. Maintaining this open dialogue and understanding between the two sides has been key to the project’s success and sustainability. In keeping with the spirit of openness, one of the core decisions has been to use existing standards (such as XML and JSON) as much as possible, release the source code of developed tools3, and provide detailed documentation for interested parties. These practices have led to users from other groups not only adopting the software, but also contributing to its development.},

abstract={Nowadays, computer programming is a core skill in computer science with software and computing-related disciplines. Thus, the demand for skilled programmers around the world is increasing. Programmers are writing codes to meet the needs of the world. Debugging source codes to search for errors is a time-consuming task, especially for logical errors for both novices and experienced programmers. We propose a language model using bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) neural network for the source code error evaluation. The BiLSTM neural network model considers both past and future context of input sequences of source codes that produces more accurate results for the error identification as well as prediction. In addition, the proposed BiLSTM language model predicts correction and error position in source codes. We trained and evaluated the proposed BiLSTM model using source codes collected from Aizu Online Judge (AOJ) system. The experimental results demonstrated that the accuracy of the proposed BiLSTM model surpassed other unidirectional RNN and LSTM models in terms of error detection and prediction in source codes. The BiLSTM model in this study can be operated as an intelligent model for source code error detection which is helpful in programming education and software engineering fields.},

abstract={One of the old and effective ways of training is the apprenticeship way. The effectiveness of training people in the workplace comes from different reasons. One reason may be the engagement of the apprentice in real-world problems. Another reason may be the close presence of the supervisor who provides the apprentice with scaffolding along the training process. Typically, at the beginning of the process the apprentice can't perform a lot without the scaffolding support, and towards the end of the process, scaffolding fades and the apprentice is capable of performing tasks alone. Industry and academia could benefit from this kind of model to ease the transition of undergraduate students from school to work and within each community, the transition from one level to a higher one. The authors have created a computerized apprenticeship on the Web for computer science education. It integrates the modules: 'Interactive Notes', 'Case Library', 'Problem-Solving Activities' and a 'Collaboration' module. They have focused on computer graphics as the first subject.},

abstract={The demand for computational power is rising rapidly in science and engineering and is now expanding into areas from the social sciences and humanities. This is met with the use of large-scale, and increasingly complex, High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems. Programming such heterogeneous and quickly evolving systems efficiently has always been challenging, particularly for novice HPC programmers, but is continually increasing in complexity. HPC service providers are therefore growing their training offerings as part of their overall service provision. However, there is no standard for understanding the impact and effectiveness of this training. Traditional training and education metrics, such as examination, are typically not applicable. Additionally, the key criteria for service providers are not only knowledge gained but the impact that the knowledge has on HPC usage. To capture and evaluate the effectiveness of training, a novel methodology with two key components is proposed: progress productivity and training productivity. The methodology includes a process for deriving an activity-specific weighted selection of the metrics that comprise the productivity measures. The proposed productivity criteria could then be applied to improve the training of HPC application programmers taking the participant's pre-knowledge and focus areas into account.},

year={2020},
volume={38},
number={2},
pages={377-388},
abstract={Software-defined networking (SDN) is fundamentally changing the way networks operate, enabling programmable and flexible network management and configuration. As the de facto standard southbound interface of SDN, OpenFlow defines how the control plane interacts with the data forwarding plane. In OpenFlow, flow tables play a significant role in packet forwarding. However, the size of the flow table is limited due to power, cost, and silicon area constraints and capacity-limited tables cannot hold all of the active flows in medium-to-large-scale SDN networks. Thus, when a flow table reaches capacity, an intelligent eviction strategy, which efficiently manages the limited flow table resource, is critical. In this paper, we propose Smart Table EntRy Eviction for OpenFlow Switches (STEREOS), which uses machine learning to classify flow entries as active or inactive and forms the basis for intelligent eviction. Trace-driven simulations demonstrate that STEREOS increases flow table usage by more than 50% and reduces incorrect flow entry evictions by up to 78%, compared with the dominant Least Recently Used eviction policy. Moreover, packet-level simulations of a datacenter network demonstrate that STEREOS can greatly reduce the control overhead, increase overall network throughput by 19%, and reduce packet loss rate by 70%.},

abstract={Laborers in factories all across the world perform physically intensive tasks daily. With every lift they put themselves at risk of injury. Many still-frame modeling systems exist that can assess the different stresses and strains on the laborers body given his or her position. These models are only usable by experts, and do not allow for real-time alerts. In 1995, companies in the United States lost $50 billion due to injured employee absences and compensation settlements. Companies are not only eager to reduce their overhead costs, but also aim to better society by offering more robust worker safety practices. The focus of this project was to design a system that can be used in a training environment. Our system is used to teach employees if their current lifting and carrying methods can be detrimental to their health. Our system is designed to be used for longstanding employees as well as new hires. This project's primary requirement was to implement a motion sensing device to aid in the analysis of ergonomics in an industrial environment. To do this we proposed to make use of Microsoft Kinect© sensors. The Kinect© is able to provide skeletal tracking at 30 frames/second for two individuals in the field of view. To develop the system we selected the Microsoft software development kit (SDK) from a large variety of alternative professional and open source SDKs because of a variety of desirable features. A static ergonomic model was integrated with the Kinect© software. Multiple other software packages were assessed for compatibility with the Kinect© in an effort to enhance the Kinects'O ability to recognize objects and humans. After development was complete the system was tested by analyzing our system's output using different skeletal lift positions to compare to the real results. Our system provides real-time ergonomic analysis of lifts performed by humans. This system lacks the ability to recognize specific individuals and objects necessary to customize the system to adequately evaluate a lift, and has not been tested in a factory environment. In the future we hope to implement a dynamic ergonomic model so that it can recognize whole movements or gestures which lead to injury, rather than recognizing a single position. Our system successfully outputs a number for the recommended weight limit as well as other methods to measure the strain on a worker's skeleton. In a training environment the system will help individuals correct the problems with their lifting motions.},

abstract={Central Venous Catheterization (CVC) involves the insertion of a catheter through the subclavian or jugular vein and into the heart when the patient requires a large influx of drugs. With the target veins so close to the lungs and vital arteries, mistakes during this procedure can be fatal. Unfortunately, it is particularly challenging for students to learn this procedure and is often practiced by novice students on live patients as current simulators are ineffective. Simulators on the market are expensive, inconvenient, and often anatomically inaccurate, leading to improper student training. To address the shortcomings of current simulators, our patent-pending design includes features such as a fully rotatable head and proper anatomical landmarks. Our training simulator is ultrasoundable and can replicate both the pulsing of the arteries and the expanding of the veins under changes in fluid pressure. In addition, our simulator comes with training software allowing for tracking of students as they progress through the curriculum. We are currently performing usability testing of our prototype. Novice residents and expert practicing doctors perform CVC on our simulator for assessment of accuracy, ease of use, and training effectiveness in comparison to commercially available simulators.},

To do so, it is necessary to incorporate skills that allow them to adapt this work philosophy, which is why in this work the use of competencies that allows to detonate social and cognitive aspects in the development of software in small teams was evaluated, as well as the frequency of use. It is also important to determine if the gender has any influence on the adoption of a certain trait. For this, groups of students were trained by developing computational problems in the field of data structure.},

abstract={Contribution: An intensive three-month educational program can be used for rapid integration of foreign-born people into the IT industry. A novel method for integrating industrial needs with the practical parts of a bachelor’s Computer Science program. Background: The program was motivated by (1) the societal need to increase the meaningful integration of immigrants into the workforce, and (2) the demand for IT specialists in the IT labor market. Intended outcomes: An effective intensive software developer program with a high level of industrial integration and a working matching model for employment. Application design: The program consists of three different phases; recruitment of participants, training and job matching. The training is divided into six modules using five different teaching methods. An evaluation model, based on passive and active data, is implemented with fast learning loops for teachers and participants. Findings: The program has been run seven times with 263 unemployed participants of different nationalities. On average 82.6 percent of the participants found employment in the IT industry within 5 months of the course ending. Female participants are in the majority and are more successful in securing employment. The findings suggest that it was possible to rapidly prototype and deliver an advanced reskilling program within a university setting and use it as a positive method to support newcomers find meaningful work that has a direct benefit for the local IT industry, as well as for the wider society.},

abstract={Despite decades of research exploring augmented reality in a variety of contexts, there have been very few studies exploring the use of commercially available components and a software development kit that is user-friendly for novices. Nearly all previous research has focused on applications that require extensive programming knowledge and experience. This trend makes the utilization of research findings in real-life settings impossible for those without in-depth training in computer science. In this paper, we report the results of an experiment with automotive technician trainees comparing a mobile application built with a user-friendly commercially available software development kit to a non-augmented computer-based manual. Results indicated that the augmented reality application enabled trainees to locate parts more quickly and accurately than when using the computer-based manual. These encouraging results are part of a larger study exploring the costs and potential benefits of augmented reality and mobile technologies in automotive technician training.},

year={2006},
volume={10},
number={1},
pages={51-58},
abstract={The increasing use of virtual reality (VR) simulators in surgical training makes it imperative that definitive studies be performed to assess their training effectiveness. Indeed, in this paper we report the meta-analysis of the efficacy of virtual reality simulators in: 1) the transference of skills from the simulator training environment to the operating room, and 2) their ability to discriminate between the experience levels of their users. The task completion time and the error score were the two study outcomes collated and analyzed in this meta-analysis. Sixteen studies were identified from a computer-based literature search (1996-2004). The meta-analysis of the random effects model (because of the heterogeneity of the data) revealed that training on virtual reality simulators did lessen the time taken to complete a given surgical task as well as clearly differentiate between the experienced and the novice trainees. Meta-analytic studies such as the one reported here would be very helpful in the planning and setting up of surgical training programs and for the establishment of reference `learning curves' for a specific simulator and surgical task. If any such programs already exist, they can then indicate the improvements to be made in the simulator used, such as providing for more variety in their case scenarios based on the state and/or rate of learning of the trainee},

abstract={For the past several years, a team in the Department of Electrical Engineering (EE), National Chung Cheng University, Taiwan, has been establishing a pedagogical approach to embody embedded systems in the context of robotics. To alleviate the burden on students in the robotics curriculum in their junior and senior years, a training platform on embedded systems with co-design in hardware and software has been developed and fabricated as a supplement for these students. This general-purpose platform has several advantages over commercial training kits for embedded systems. For instance, the programming layer has been brought onto an open-source platform ported by Linux and μC/OS-II such that it is mostly hardware-independent. Meanwhile, in addition to linking to fundamental library functions provided for robotics, users can program the codes not only in C language, but also through visual programming by means of a graphic interface developed along with the platform, allowing users to concentrate on higher-level robot function design. In other words, the platform facilitates rapid prototyping in robotics design. Meanwhile, a tailored laboratory manual associated with the platform has been designed and used in classes. Based on assessments and evaluation on the students who have completed this course, the curricular training is satisfactory and largely meets the requirements established at the design stage.},

abstract={A newcomer to a software project must typically come up-to-speed on a large, varied amount of information about the project before becoming productive. Assimilating this information in the open-source context is difficult because a newcomer cannot rely on the mentoring approach that is commonly used in traditional software developments. To help a newcomer to an open-source project become productive faster, we propose Hipikat, a tool that forms an implicit group memory from the information stored in a project's archives, and that recommends artifacts from the archives that are relevant to a task that a newcomer is trying to perform. To investigate this approach, we have instantiated the Hipikat tool for the Eclipse open-source project. In this paper we describe the Hipikat tool, we report on a qualitative study conducted with a Hipikat mock-up on a medium-sized in-house project, and we report on a case study in which Hipikat recommendations were evaluated for a task on Eclipse.},

abstract={Testing scientific software is challenging because usually such type of systems have non-deterministic behaviours and, in addition, they generate non-trivial outputs such as images. Artificial intelligence (AI) is now a reality which is also helping in the development of the software testing activity. In this article, we evaluate seven deep neural networks (DNNs), precisely deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with up to 161layers, playing the role of test oracle procedures for testing scientific models. Firstly, we propose a method, TOrC, which starts by generating training, validation, and test image datasets via combinatorial interaction testing applied to the original codes and second-order mutants. Within TOrC we also have classical steps such as transfer learning, a technique recommended for DNNs. Then, we verified the performance of the oracles (CNNs). The main conclusions of this research are: i) not necessarily a greater number of layers means that a CNN will present better performance; ii) transfer learning is a valuable technique but eventually we may need extended solutions to get better performances; iii) data-centric AI is an interesting path to follow; and iv) there is not a clear correlation between the software bugs, in the scientific models, and the errors (image misclassifications) presented by the CNNs.

abstract={In this paper, we propose a destination-aware adaptive traffic flow rule aggregation (DATA) mechanism for facilitating traffic flow monitoring in SDN-based networks. This method adapts the number of flow table entries in SDN switches according to the level of detail of traffic flow information that other mechanisms (e.g. for traffic engineering, traffic monitoring, intrusion detection) require. It also prevents performance degradation of the SDN switches by keeping the number of flow table entries well below a critical level. This level is not preset as a hard threshold but learned during operation by using a machine-learning based algorithm. The DATA method is implemented within a RESTful application (DATA App) which monitors and analyzes the ongoing network traffic and provides instructions to the SDN controller to adapt the traffic flow matching strategies accordingly. A thorough performance evaluation of DATA is conducted in an SDN emulation environment. The results show that-compared to the default behavior of common SDN controllers-the proposed DATA approach yields significant SDN switch performance improvements while still providing detailed traffic flow information on demand.},

Our objective is to present the design and evaluation of a postgraduate course for requirements inspection training. We conducted an empirical study with 138 postgraduate students, teamed up in 34 groups to conduct requirements inspection. We performed qualitative analysis on the data collected from students' reflection reports to assess the effects of the pedagogical design in terms of benefits and challenges. We also quantitatively analyze the correlation between the students' performance in conducting inspections and their ability of writing specifications. From the analysis of students' reflections, several themes emerged such as their difficulty of working with limited information, but also revealed the benefits of learning teamwork and writing good requirements. This qualitative analysis also provides recommendations for improving the related activities. The results revealed a moderate positive correlation between the performance in writing specification and inspection.},

abstract={Students can benefit from contributing to Open Source Software (OSS), since they can enrich their portfolio and learn with real world projects. However, sometimes students are demotivated to contribute due to entrance barriers.

The goal of this work is to analyze the use of gamification to orient and motivate undergraduate students to overcome onboarding barriers and engage to OSS projects. To achieve this goal, we implemented four gaming elements (Quests, Points, Ranking, and Levels) in GitLab and assessed the environment by means of a study conducted with 17 students, within a real OSS project (JabRef). At the end of the study, the students evaluated their experience through a questionnaire. We found that the Quest element helped to guide participants and keep them motivated and points helped by providing feedback on students' performed tasks. We conclude that the gamified environment oriented the students in an attempt to make a contribution and that gamification can motivate and orient newcomers' to engage to OSS projects.},

abstract={The names of software artifacts, e.g., method names, are important for software understanding and maintenance, as good names can help developers easily understand others’ code. However, the existing naming guidelines are difficult for developers, especially novices, to come up with meaningful, concise and compact names for the variables, methods, classes and files. With the popularity of open source, an enormous amount of project source code can be accessed, and the exhaustiveness and instability of manually naming methods could now be relieved by automatically learning a naming model from a large code repository. Nevertheless, building a comprehensive naming system is still challenging, due to the gap between natural language functional descriptions and method names. Specifically, there are three challenges: how to model the relationship between the functional descriptions and formal method names, how to handle the explosion of vocabulary when dealing with large repositories, and how to leverage the knowledge learned from large repositories to a specific project. To answer these questions, we propose a neural network to directly generate readable method names from natural language description. The proposed method is built upon the encoder-decoder framework with the attention and copying mechanisms. Our experiments show that our method can generate meaningful and accurate method names and achieve significant improvement over the state-of-the-art baseline models. We also address the cold-start problem using a training trick to utilize big data in Github for specific projects.},

In this new era of industrial scenario, companies will need technicians and workers with digital skills mainly having abilities and competences in the Industry 4.0 Key Enabling Technologies (KET). However, lack of digital skills in the UK is considered perhaps the most serious obstacle to the practical implementation and investment in manufacturing digitalization technologies and is thus a major contributing factor to the UK productivity gap. Aiming to bridge the gap between the implementation of Industry 4.0 and educational organizations that focus on this field, the study presented here focuses on the development of a degree apprenticeship program in Digital technology solutions (DTS). The DTS program is developed in collaboration with leading UK industry partners to acquaint apprentices with appropriate knowledge that can help them to contribute towards digital transformation of their businesses.},

abstract={Executable and Translatable UML enables Model-Driven Architecture by specifying Platform-Independent Models that can be automatically transformed into Platform-Specific Models through model compilation. Previous research shows that the transformations result in both efficient code and consistency between the models. However, there are neither results for the effort of introducing the technology in a new context nor on the level of expertise needed for designing the Platform-Independent Models. We wanted to know if teams of novice software developers could design Executable and Translatable UML models without prior experiences of software modelling. As part of a new university course we conducted an exploratory case study with two data collections over two years. Bachelor students were given the task to design a hotel reservation system and the necessary test cases for verifying the functionality and structure of the models within 300 hours, using Executable and Translatable UML. In total, 43 out of 50 teams succeeded in delivering verified and consistent models within the time frame. During the second data collection the students were given limited tool training. This gave a raise in the quality of the models. Due to the executable feature of the models the students were given constant feedback on their design until the models behaved as expected, with the required level of detail and structure. Our results show that using Executable and Translatable UML does not require more expertise than a bachelor program in computer science. All in all, Executable and Translatable UML could play an important role in future software development.},

abstract={The Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasts that approximately 175,100 software engineering jobs will be created between 2008 and 2018. In order to fill these positions, new computer scientists, who enjoy and are competent in the art of programming and software design, must be trained. Computer science departments must look for novel approaches to attract non-traditional students, i.e. women and minorities, to the major, in order to fill the positions predicted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Additionally, although computer science enrollment has increased in the freshman and sophomore levels over the past few years, computer science departments are still faced with identifying new approaches to teaching programming that will retain students, particularly if some of them have weak mathematics backgrounds and are placed directly in CS1. In this paper, a study to determine the effectiveness of a CS0 course using Scratch for improving the retention, the performance and the attitudes of at-risk majors is discussed. Initial assessments associated with the study indicate that students of the target group who program using Scratch have a high degree of perceived self-efficacy with respect to their programming abilities. Furthermore, results to date indicate that the originally at-risk students in the study went on to successfully complete CS1 with a passing rate of 74% compared to a 39% passing rate in CS1 by the students who had sufficiently high mathematics scores upon entry into the university.},

Resource providers and researchers, new to the topic of Grid computing, have to overcome a huge inhibition threshold before work in this area can be started. The SuGI project is aiming to support providers and researchers with two approaches. First, the SuGI portal presents videos, documents, and links regarding many topics in the area of Grid computing for newcomers as well as for experts. Second, the training systems for Grid middlewares created by the SuGI project can help beginners to do their first steps without a complex installation process, while experts can easily try out different configurations without interfering with their productive systems.},

abstract={In the procedure of aviation equipment maintenance, a healthy status and prior knowledge are essential to every person. Making the newcomers get familiar with their tasks rapidly and reducing human error are important issues. Augmented reality (AR) integrated with the popular artificial intelligence (AI) technology can provide smart system inspections and train maintenance professionals on how to perform important maintenance procedures effectively and accurately. Utilization of the AR not only replaces classic manual training but also provides high mobility pre-training opportunities. In other words, AR is capable of taking equipment maintenance to the next level. In this paper, an application for aviation equipment inspection is developed. By using AR and AI, traditional standard operation procedures (SOP) can be visualized and standardized. Therefore, people who are not familiar with the maintenance procedure can still finish the standard inspections. The developed software gives a great contribution to human resources for maintenance training. Demonstrations including turbofan and landing gear are provided by using HoloLens 2 to illustrate the application novelty. Finally, pros and cons regarding maintenance using AR are also discussed.},

abstract={Traditionally, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software uses Message Passing Interface (MPI) to handle the parallelism over distributed memory systems. For a new developer, such as a student or a new employee, the barrier of entry can be high and more training is required for each particular software package, which slows down the research process on actual science. The Chapel programming language offers an interesting alternative for research and development of CFD applications.In this paper, the developments of two CFD applications are presented: the first one as an experiment by re-writing a 2D structured flow solver and the second one as writing from scratch a research 3D unstructured multi-physics simulation software. Details are given on both applications with emphasis on the Chapel features which were used positively in the code design, in particular to improve flexibility and extend to distributed memory. Some performance pitfalls are discussed with solutions to avoid them.The performance of the unstructured software is then studied and compared to a traditional open-source CFD software package programmed in C++ with MPI for communication (SU2). The results show that our Chapel implementation achieves performances similar to other CFD software written in C and C++, thus confirming that Chapel is a viable language for high-performance CFD applications.},

abstract={Voice recognition software is a widely adopted tool in a variety of task domains. However, several mission critical systems, which have high security demands cannot allow outside connections to the remote systems that provide voice recognition capabilities. This presents a problem for modern day voice recognition, which is largely cloud based. To address this issue, we leveraged Julius as an offline phoneme-based voice recognizer in order to incorporate voice recognition software into robotic systems for law enforcement officers. In order to address the difficulties that officers with a variety of dialects have when interacting with a phoneme-based voice recognizer, a training tool was developed. This paper examines the lessons learned from the latest implementation of the training tool over the course of several voice-enabled Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) experiments. The majority of these users were novices who had little to no experience with voice recognition software. Interactions were completed at three events in Košice, Slovakia: (1) Museum Night 2018, (2) a private company demonstration, and (3) Technical University of Košice's Summer Kids University (TUKE for kids) demonstration. The results of the user interaction evaluations highlighted that, through training, novice users could learn to interact with an offline voice recognition system after a short period of time by operating a simulated robotic system.},

PROUST takes as input a program and a nonalgorithmic description of the program requirements, and finds the most likely mapping between the requirements and the code. This mapping is in essence a reconstruction of the design and implementation steps that the programmer went through in writing the program. A knowledge base of programming plans and strategies, together with common bugs associated with them, is used in constructing this mapping. Bugs are discovered in the process of relating plans to the code; PROUST can therefore give deep explanations of program bugs by relating the buggy code to its underlying intentions.},

year={2022},
volume={9},
number={15},
pages={13740-13754},
abstract={Academia and industry have developed several platforms to support the popular privacy-preserving distributed learning method—federated learning (FL). However, these platforms are complex to use and require a deep understanding of FL, which imposes high barriers to entry for beginners, limits the productivity of researchers, and compromises deployment efficiency. In this article, we propose the first low-code FL platform, EasyFL, to enable users with various levels of expertise to experiment and prototype FL applications with little coding. We achieve this goal while ensuring great flexibility and extensibility for customization by unifying simple API design, modular design, and granular training flow abstraction. With only a few lines of code (LOC), EasyFL empowers them with many out-of-the-box functionalities to accelerate experimentation and deployment. These practical functionalities are heterogeneity simulation, comprehensive tracking, distributed training optimization, and seamless deployment. They are proposed based on challenges identified in the proposed FL life cycle. Compared with other platforms, EasyFL not only requires just three LOC (at least $10\times $ lesser) to build a vanilla FL application but also incurs lower training overhead. Besides, our evaluations demonstrate that EasyFL expedites distributed training by $1.5\times $ . It also improves the efficiency of deployment. We believe that EasyFL will increase the productivity of researchers and democratize FL to wider audiences.},

abstract={Training to perform robotic surgery is time-consuming with uncertain metrics of the level of achieved skill. We tested the feasibility of using muscle co-contraction as a metric to quantify robotic surgical skill in a virtual simulation environment. We recruited six volunteers with varying skill levels in robotic surgery. The volunteers performed virtual tasks using a robotic console while we recorded their muscle activity. A co-contraction metric was then derived from the activity of pairs of opposing hand muscles and compared to the scores assigned by the training software. We found that muscle-based metrics were more sensitive than motion-based scores in quantifying the different levels of skill between simulated tasks and in novices vs. experts across different tasks. Therefore, muscle-based metrics may help quantify in general terms the level of robotic surgical skill and could potentially be used for biofeedback to increase the rate of learning.},

abstract={The chief question I will address is: in a sea of open-source projects, how might mid- or senior-level developers' best mentor early career developers? As a software engineering apprentice, I have had the unique experience of swimming through opensource projects and ultimately finding tech workspaces that align with my values (open science and collaboration) and interests (biochemistry and neuroscience). During this transition time, mentorship played a crucial role in making this happen! So often, tech workspaces lack diversity, and when they are open to individuals from different backgrounds, these spaces do not feel safe. This makes the need for identity-related support evident. My talk highlights the importance of effective and empathetic mentorship and best mentorship practices for mentoring those with different identities from the mentee's perspective. As a Black trans person, I was initially hesitant to be mentored by my white coworker because sharing one's interests and admitting to not knowing where to begin felt vulnerable. During my talk, I plan to briefly share my story detailing how my mentor and I cultivated trust, which shifted my vulnerability into self-confidence in my work. This talk also provides solutions for growing diverse and sustainable teams where trust, learning, and experimentation are encouraged! I will pinpoint the strategies my mentor and I utilized over those six months and have continued to use to this day. This talk is necessary for anyone interested in gaining more effective mentorship strategies as they guide individuals with different identities and for any mentees, like me, interested in advice on navigating mentor/mentee relationships. You do not necessarily need to hold the title of “mentor” to utilize these strategies, most folks in this field guide others in some capacity. Overall, I aim to show how mentorship plays a crucial role in growing diverse and sustainable teams within the workplace.},

To better understand how system developers struggle with Xacros, we manually examine 712 Xacro-related questions from the question and answer site answers.ros.org and find Xacro misunderstandings fit into eight key categories using a systematic, qualitative approach called Open Coding. By examining the 'tags' applied to questions, we further find that Xacro problems manifest in a befuddlingly broad set of contexts. This hinders onboarding and complicates system developers' understanding of representations and tools in the Robot Operating System. We aim to provide an empirical grounding that identifies and prioritizes impediments to users of open robotics systems, so that tool designers, teachers, and robotics practitioners can devise ways of improving robot software tooling and education.},

abstract={Software development has become increasingly software 'product' development, without the authoritative 'customer' stakeholder role that many requirements engineering processes assume exists in some form. Many progressive software product companies today are empowering cross-functional product teams to own their product - to collectively understand the product context, the true product needs, and manage its on-going evolution. Some teams do this better than others and neither established requirements elicitation and validation processes nor conventional team leadership practices explain the reasons for the differences. This research inquires into how cross-functional product teams, as a collective, create and nurture a shared mental model that accurately represents the external product domain and its realities. The research also examines how teams use that collective understanding to shape development plans, internal and external communications, new team member onboarding, etc. The aim of this research is to develop substantive theory that describes how self-directed, cross-functional product development teams take an empathic-based approach to discovering, understanding, and maintaining a deep, collective understanding of the domain and true product needs. This theory will support software product development leaders in creating rich-er conditions for teams to grok.},

abstract={Open source/free software can be extremely powerful and valuable at little or no cost. Student familiarity with open source/free software is essential for success in the computer science environment. It does, however include some risks: heterogeneous network security concerns, a steep learning curve, and frequent bureaucratic restrictions to overcome. This project overcame these concerns while providing a powerful suite of open source tools to interested students at no cost. More specifically, the software package adheres to security constraints of the institution's existing Windows-based network.

pages={104-114},
abstract={Exception handling is widely used in software development to guarantee code robustness and system reliability. Developers are expected to choose appropriate handling strategies to ensure exceptions are handled properly without causing program crashes or unintended behaviors. However, making such choices is challenging especially for the novices due to lack of experience on exceptional flow design. To assist developers in deciding how to handle exceptions, we propose a method to automatically recommend exception handling strategies based on program context. This method learns practices of exception handling from existing high-quality projects and code by well-skilled developers. We extracted three type of program context (exceptional context, architectural context, and functional context) as features and applied machine learning techniques to recommend an optimized strategy of exception handling. We conducted the evaluation on 10 open source Java projects. Experimental results show that our approach reaches high prediction accuracy in choosing exception handling strategies.},

abstract={Each new Mars rover has pursued increasingly richer science while tolerating a wider variety of environmental conditions and hardware degradation over longer mission operation duration. Sojourner operated for 83 sols (Martian days), Spirit for 2208 sols, and Opportunity is at 5111 sols, and Curiosity operation is ongoing at 2208 sols. To handle this increase in capability, the complexity of onboard flight software has increased. MSL (also known as Curiosity), uses more flight software lines of code than all previous missions to Mars combined, including both successes and failures[1]. MSL has more than 4,200 commands with as many as dozens of arguments, 54,000 parameters, and tens of thousands of additional state variables. A single high-level command may perform hours of configurable robotic arm and sampling behavior. Incorrect usage can result in the loss of an activity or the loss of the mission. Surface Simulation (“SSim”) was developed to address the challenge of making full and effective use of many capabilities of MSL, while managing complexity and risk. SSim is software that performs rapid context sensitive simulation of flight software. NASA Mars missions are comprised of three phases: several months of Cruise, a brief but exciting Entry Descent and Landing (EDL), and a Surface mission that typically lasts as long as the hardware survives. SSim is meant for use during the surface phase when the mission fulfills its primary objectives. The focus of SSim on MSL was the robotic flight software, including rover mobility and navigation, robotic arm manipulation, and sample acquisition, processing, and delivery. It can execute behaviors in simulation a thousand times faster than they execute in real time on the flight compute element. SSim is used by rover drivers to develop and validate command sequences throughout the planning cycle. SSim has been used to plan all of the Curiosity robotic operations since landing and is expected to continue to be used for the remaining life of the rover. Due to the impact of SSim on MSL, the Mars 2020 mission plans to increase the scope of SSim during flight operations, simulating not only rover planner operations, but all surface operations, including the instrument, power, thermal and telecommunication behavior. SSim is part of the Rover Sequencing and Visualization (RSVP) suite of Rover Planning tools [2]. In the paper we provide an overview of SSim architecture, design, implementation, and usage on MSL, as well as an overview of plans for Mars 2020.},

abstract={An exponential increase has been observed in number of mobile game players in last five years. An increasing number of researches have been emerged that assesses the cognitive aspects of video game players. This creates a need to classify the expert-novice level of a player. A novel approach to classify players expert-novice level is to use machine learning algorithm by considering recorded electroencephalography (EEG) signals of player while playing mobile games. In this research work, EEG signals of ten mobile game players is recorded by commercially available 14 channel EMOTIV headset. After preprocessing stage, a feature vector is created in such a way that from each channel, thirteen morphological features are extracted. The extracted features are used to train three different classification algorithms. The Naive Bayes performed with an accuracy of 89:89%. From results, it is evident that EEG can be used to classify the expert-novice level of a player using machine algorithms. These results can be useful in the development of new and interesting entertainment and educational mobile games taking into account the player's cognition using EEG.},

abstract={This Work in Progress paper in the Research category studies undergraduate students use of higher order metacognitive skills while engaging in computational modeling engineering research. Policymakers, universities and other key stakeholders have promoted `authentic learning experiences' including undergraduate research experiences as a vehicle for the cognitive and metacognitive development of undergraduates. Indeed, undergraduate research experiences in STEM fields have been demonstrated to have positive effects including enhanced technical skills development and greater persistence in STEM degrees. However, specific research is needed to understand how metacognitive skills are engaged during undergraduate research experiences. Further, work on undergraduate research experiences has typically focused on science research, and relatively little work has been done to understand student development during research experiences in engineering and computational fields. To address this gap, we have initiated a qualitative study of undergraduate researchers within a computational modeling engineering research group at a large midwestern university. Here, we share preliminary results from semi-structured interviews of undergraduate student researchers and their supervisors. The research and implications of our work are grounded within a cognitive apprenticeship framework and will provide insight into how best to support the cognitive and metacognitive development of undergraduate engineering researchers.},

This paper presents designing and developing a cardiac coronary interventions simulator with vital functions of computing and animation. This simulator is integrated hardware that implements the compute model and a software system that deploys the animate model. The developed simulator is designed for novice cardiac surgeons that learn complex coronary intervention procedures. A plastic tube is used to mimic a catheter wire. The catheter wire movements are converted to single digits through the compute model. These values are transferred to the animate model that maps each value to a line segment for visualization. A comparison based on twenty features with recent state-of-the-art works found in literature shows the proposed simulator provides a feature-rich medical device. Additionally, the simulator with few modifications is a potential artificial intelligence internet of things device.},

abstract={Behavior studies on the neurobiological effects of environmental, pharmacological and physiological manipulations in lab animals try to correlate these procedures with specific changes in animal behavior. Parameters such as duration, latency and frequency are assessed from the visually recorded sequences of behaviors, to distinguish changes due to manipulation. Since behavioral recording procedure is intrinsically interpretative, high variability in experimental results is expected and usual, due to observer-related influences such as experience, knowledge, stress, fatigue and personal biases. Here, we present a computer program that supports the assessment of inter- and intra-observer concordance, using statistical indices (e.g., Kappa and Kendal coefficients and concordance index). The software was tested in a case study with 4 different observers, naïve to behavioral recording procedures. On paired analysis, the higher agreement index achieved was 0.76 (concordance index) and 0.47 (Kappa Coefficient, where 0 is no agreement and 1 is total agreement). Observers showed poor concordance indices (lower than 0.7), emphasizing the concern on observer recording stability and on precise morphological definition of the recorded behaviors. These indices can also be used to train observers and to refine the behavioral catalogue definitions, as they are related to different behavioral recording aspects.},

pages={1273-1285},
abstract={As a popular Q&A site for programming, Stack Overflow is a treasure for developers. However, the amount of questions and answers on Stack Overflow make it difficult for developers to efficiently locate the information they are looking for. There are two gaps leading to poor search results: the gap between the user's intention and the textual query, and the semantic gap between the query and the post content. Therefore, developers have to constantly reformulate their queries by correcting misspelled words, adding limitations to certain programming languages or platforms, etc. As query reformulation is tedious for developers, especially for novices, we propose an automated software-specific query reformulation approach based on deep learning. With query logs provided by Stack Overflow, we construct a large-scale query reformulation corpus, including the original queries and corresponding reformulated ones. Our approach trains a Transformer model that can automatically generate candidate reformulated queries when given the user's original query. The evaluation results show that our approach outperforms five state-of-the-art baselines, and achieves a 5.6% to 33.5% boost in terms of ExactMatch and a 4.8% to 14.4% boost in terms of GLEU.},

The vehicle sensory system is composed of a low-cost Inertial Measurement Unit (which includes 3 magnetometers) and a standard GPS receiver. The onboard computer sends data from the onboard sensors to a Ground Control Station (GCS) and receives navigation commands from it. These commands are then used to drive the ground vehicle's DC motors using PWM (Pulse-Width Modulation) signals. The Ground Control Station software implements an Extended Kalman Filter for sensor data fusion. An ethernet shield and an ethernet wifi bridge are used for wireless communication between the vehicle onboard computer and the Ground Control Station. A two-wheeled vehicle model was used to develop the vehicle controller and to tune the Kalman Filter parameters. Simulations and real-world test results of the proposed autonomous navigation procedure are presented and discussed for a path-following experiment.},

abstract={Learning interface agents search regularities in the user behavior and use them to predict user's actions. We propose a new inductive concept learning approach, called IBHYS, to learn such regularities. This approach limits the hypothesis search to a small portion of the hypothesis space by letting each training example build a local approximation of the global target function. It allows to simultaneously search several hypothesis spaces and to simultaneously handle hypotheses described in different languages. This approach is particularly suited for learning interface agents because it provides an incremental algorithm with low training time and decision time, which does not require the designer of the interface agent to describe in advance and quite carefully the repetitive patterns searched. We illustrate our approach with two autonomous software agents, the Apprentice and the Assistant, devoted to assist users of interactive programming environments and implemented in Objectworks Smalltalk-80. The Apprentice learns user's work habits using an IBHYS algorithm and the Assistant, based on what has been learnt, proposes to the programmer sequences of actions the user might want to redo. We show, with experimental results on real data, that IBHYS outperforms ID3 both in computing time and predictive accuracy.},

year={2021},
volume={67},
number={10},
pages={6675-6710},
abstract={With the growing use of machine learning algorithms in highly consequential domains, the quantification and removal of disparity in decision making with respect to protected attributes, such as gender, race, etc., is becoming increasingly important. While quantifying disparity is essential, sometimes the needs of a business (e.g., hiring) may require the use of certain features that are critical in a way that any disparity that can be explained by them might need to be exempted. For instance, in hiring a software engineer for a safety-critical application, a coding-test score may be a critical feature that is weighed strongly in the decision even if it introduces disparity, whereas other features, such as name, zip code, or reference letters may be used to improve decision-making, but only to the extent that they do not add disparity. In this work, we propose a novel information-theoretic decomposition of the total disparity (a quantification inspired from counterfactual fairness) into two components: a non-exempt component which quantifies the part of the disparity that cannot be accounted for by the critical features, and an exempt component which quantifies the remaining disparity. This decomposition is important: it allows one to check if the disparity arose purely due to the critical features (inspired from the business necessity defense of disparate impact law) and also enables selective removal of the non-exempt component of disparity if desired. We arrive at this decomposition through canonical examples that lead to a set of desirable properties (axioms) that any measure of non-exempt disparity should satisfy. We then demonstrate that our proposed counterfactual measure of non-exempt disparity satisfies all of them. Our quantification bridges ideas of causality, Simpson's paradox, and a body of work from information theory called Partial Information Decomposition (PID). We also obtain an impossibility result showing that no observational measure of non-exempt disparity can satisfy all of the desired properties, which leads us to relax our goals and examine alternative observational measures that satisfy only some of these properties. We perform case studies to show how one can audit existing models as well as train new models while reducing non-exempt disparity.},

abstract={Mechanical assembly courses are widely set up for mechanical and vehicle engineering majors. Teaching in these classes is traditionally presented in the form of 2-D lectures, which are ineffective for students to understand complex 3-D information. The study presented in this article aimed to investigate whether augmented reality (AR) could improve students’ learning efficacy in a mechanical assembly course. An AR-based assembly instruction app on mobile devices was developed, and a comparative research approach was adopted. A total of 104 junior students from four classes on automotive engineering at Nanjing Forestry University participated in the experiment during their professional skill training course. The control group was provided with handouts as usual, and the experimental group was required to use AR instructions during the assembly processes. Several evaluation indicators, such as assembly quality and speed, were recorded and analyzed at the same time. The results showed that such indicators were significantly improved with the utilization of AR. In addition, a questionnaire was specifically designed and distributed to all the students at the end of the course. It was found that several learning factors, such as learning interest and academic achievements in the experimental group, showed a positive correlation.},

Most of them are new but are ready for use by developers. As the review one result, it became clear that ML libraries are quite accessible to students and even high school students. The advantage of Web languages is that they are useful both for understanding ready projects and for direct use: only a web browser and development environment are required to run an ML project in JavaScript. The review is useful for undergraduates, graduates, postgraduates and novice developers of artificial intelligence systems and KBIS.},

abstract={Listening to music is a pastime most people enjoy. We're all fascinated with music and resort to listening to it in times when we're in a good mood and also while in distress. While a variety of applications and softwares exist that let musicians make music, there is not much development in the field for novices who do not understand music. This paper aims to change that. Not everyone should need to be an expert in the field to be able to create melodious pieces of music. This paper gives an approach to be able to do the same using Recurrent Neural Networks. The idea is to build a model that trains using existing melodies or instrumentals and generate new music based on the training. The approach will not only be helpful to people who do not know the field well but also to musicians to be able to generate fine quality music that can be developed further to make decent length songs. We aim to create music without having a need to play musical instruments physically.},

abstract={This document aims to develop and demonstrate the operation of a prototype capable of recognizing the alphabet of the Peruvian Sign Language and translating it into the Spanish language alphabet, based on an optimized multilayer artificial neural network approach, with the purpose of improving the communication, fluency and reciprocity of a daily conversion with listeners who do not know sign language. Bend sensors were used to record the movement and variation of each letter. Then, through an Arduino – Excel interface, a database of a test user was compiled for training and validation, likewise, the neural network was developed in Matlab software for the recognition of signals (letters). Subsequently, the real-time data acquisition of the test user was performed through a Matlab-Arduino interface that, in conjunction with the online prediction algorithm and the neural network, recognized the desired letter. Finally, an artificial voice algorithm developed in the Matlab software was used to reproduce the recognized lyrics, and another, which allows the corresponding signal to be viewed online. The prototype developed has an accuracy of 94.60% for the training set and 94.32% for the validation set, in turn, the cost was 120 USD. It is concluded that this prototype is capable of translating Peruvian Sign Language with a high percentage of accuracy, also is viable and economical, so it is recommended to test the effectiveness of this prototype in multiple people with speech disabilities.},

title={A Smart Factory in a Smart City: Virtual and Augmented Reality in a Smart Assembly Line},
year={2020},
volume={8},

pages={94330-94340},
abstract={Increasingly, the smart city space is requiring a reconceptualization of forms and factors of production, including factories and their place in the smart city space. Factories have always been a part of the city and many people spend a significant part of their lives there. Cities and factories share the same physical space and draw from the same resources, such as the energy grid, communication networks, public utilities, social connections, etc. Factories and cities should share the same IoT network in order to maximize their synergy level. In this view, as ICT-enhanced solutions are being implemented and so the concept of the smart city becomes a reality, it is mandatory that the connection between the smart city and the smart factory is examined. This paper represents the first step in this direction. We are presenting a new smart way to lighten the workload for employees (especially those involved in assembly, setup and maintenance) and increase factory efficiency. We have developed a brand-new smart solution for designing and presenting work instructions. The solution can be easily adapted to use in other fields like healthcare or smart-homes. This paper presents a comparison of different types of virtual/augmented and conventional assembly instructions. Today, we face the challenge of a lack of skilled employees and a high rate of employee turnover. Both result in huge time and production losses, because new employees have to be taught simple assembly tasks over and over again. In addition, as companies begin hiring many more foreign workers who do not understand the local language, the challenge of teaching becomes even more acute. Despite this, in modern production systems we can still find ineffective and complicated books and manuals with assembly, service and measurement instructions. We have prepared several variants for non-trivial multi-step assembly instructions: traditional “paper” instructions, video instructions, virtual instructions on screen (with/without in-situ projection and with/without a special controller). We have developed our own software system for working with and developing virtual assembly instructions. In this case the in-situ augmentation is a projection on to different parts of the workplace. 60 subjects were tested over two years in order to gather the learning curve for each of 5 types of instructions using virtual and augmented reality. We have proven that using any type other than “paper” will shorten the learning time by approximately half. Practitioner summary: We have prepared and tested variants for non-trivial multi-step assembly instructions. 60 subjects were tested over two years in order to gather the learning curve for all 5 types of instructions – traditional paper, video instructions, virtual instructions and two types of virtual instructions combined with augmented reality in-situ projection. We have proven that using any type other than “paper” will shorten the learning time by approximately half.},

pages={2927-2935},
abstract={We present PizzaText, a circular keyboard layout technique for text entry in virtual reality (VR) environments that uses the dual thumbsticks of a hand-held game controller. Text entry is a common activity in VR environments but remains challenging with existing techniques and keyboard layouts that is largely based on QWERTY. Our technique makes text entry simple, easy, and efficient, even for novice users. The technique uses a hand-held controller because it is still an important input device for users to interact with VR environments. To allow rapid search of characters, PizzaText divides a circle into slices and each slice contains 4 characters. To enable fast selection, the user uses the right thumbstick for traversing the slices, and the left thumbstick for choosing the letters. The design of PizzaText is based on three criteria: efficiency, learnability, and ease-of-use. In our first study, six potential layouts are considered and evaluated. The results lead to a design with 7 slices and 4 letters per slice. The final design is evaluated in a five-day study with 10 participants. The results show that novice users can achieve an average of 8.59 Words per Minute (WPM), while expert users are able to reach 15.85 WPM, with just two hours of training.},

pages={833-846},
abstract={The user interface (UI) is a key component of an interactive software application; therefore, it is important to provide software developers with basic UI design skills. However, teaching UI design is challenging, even at a basic level, and there is little teaching support. In this article, we investigate the benefits of the feedback-enriched simulation environment (FENIkS) for learning fundamental UI design principles toward designing the functional aspects of a UI. FENIkS is a model-driven educational environment making use of simulation as learning support by generating a UI and the underlying application starting from conceptual domain and presentation models. The generated application and UI contain feedback elements for the learners. This feedback shows if the generated prototype is compliant with certain key design principles and why the principles are considered to be well applied or not. We conducted an experiment using bachelor-level courses to observe the effects of FENIkS on the learning of UI design principles by novice UI designers. The effectiveness of FENIkS was measured by comparing the results of students on a test performed without and with the use of FENIkS, using statistical methods. The findings show an improvement in student's learning of UI design principles when using the FENIkS approach.},

The system is unique in that it can be trained to recognize a new gesture by simply demonstrating the gesture once. From then on, the system improves its recognition accuracy over time by learning from experience. The classification scheme utilizes a nearest neighbor approach with a dynamic time warping distance metric. The approach robustly handles both temporal and spatial variations in executions of highly dynamic and complex gestures. One product of the research is an open source software package that will work with little to no modifications on robots utilizing a 3D depth sensor and the Robot Operating System (ROS). Experimental results show the ability of novice users to train and utilize the system effectively, as well as the system's ability to increase its recognition accuracy over time by learning from experience.},

abstract={With today's increasing complexity of systems and requirements there is a need for formal analysis of requirements. Although there exist several formal requirements description languages and corresponding analysis tools that target an industrial audience, there is a large gap between the form of requirements and the training in formal methods available in industry today, and the form of requirements and the knowledge that is necessary to successfully operate the analysis tools. We propose a process to bridge the gap between customer requirements and formal analysis. The process is designed to support in-house formalisation and analysis as well as formalisation and analysis as a service provided by a third party. The basic idea is that we obtain dependability and comprehensibility by assuming a senior formal requirements engineer who prepares the requirements and later interprets the analysis results in tandem with the client. We obtain scalability as most of the formalisation and analysis is supposed to be conducted by junior formal requirements engineers. In this paper, we define and analyse the process and report on experience from different instantiations, where the process was well received by customers.},

abstract={Intelligent learning environments can be designed to support the development of learners' cognitive skills, strategies, and metacognitive processes as they work on complex decision-making and problem-solving tasks. However, the complexity of the tasks may impede the progress of novice learners. Providing adaptive feedback to learners who face difficulties requires learner modeling approaches that can identify learners' proficiencies and the difficulties they face in executing required skills, strategies, and metacognitive processes. This paper discusses a multilevel hierarchical learner modeling scheme that analyzes and captures learners' cognitive processes and problem-solving strategies along with their performance on assigned tasks in a game-based environment called UrbanSim that requires complex decision making for dealing with counterinsurgency scenarios. As the scenario evolves in a turn-by-turn fashion, UrbanSim evaluates the learners' moves using a number of performance measures. Our learner modeling scheme interprets the reported performance values by analyzing the learners' activities captured in log files to derive learners' proficiencies in associated cognitive skills and strategies, and updates the learner model. We discuss the details of the learner modeling algorithms in this paper, and then demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by presenting results from a study we conducted at Vanderbilt University.},

abstract={This paper introduces a newly developed automatic classification system for wedge tightness inside the generator by applying support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The automatic classifying system for wedge tightness of the generator consists of 4 parts including data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. Machine learning algorithm called SVM is used with the linear and radial basis function (RBF) classifier. Each input feature is extracted in different ways to evaluate the performance of classification. The evaluation is completed by using a 10- fold cross validation technique to provide high accuracy and a low number of False Negatives (FN). By applying the proposed system, the number of tightness and looseness inside wedge generator can be classified. Based on the classification results, the signals extracted in the frequency domain gives the best performance among the time domain and the frequency domain. This paper shows that the automatic classifying method has a high potential to identify the wedge tightness inside the generator.},

pages={81-88},
abstract={Human resource managers have typically used certifications as an indicator of an individual skill set suitability for a specific position. Certifications act as a signal to hiring managers that a job candidate has achieved a level of knowledge and skill necessary to perform in a particular job role. In the IT (Information Technologies) sector, a recent study sought to determine if human resource managers (HR) and IT professionals perceived certifications differently in the context of the hiring process. The purpose of this exploratory case study was to determine how IT professionals perceive certification programs as a professional training alternative, when compared with more traditional education settings, and the kind of effect the effective participation in one of the programs has in that judgment. The data for this exploratory study was gathered from a 58 employee sample of a Portuguese-based multinational software engineering company. An experimental Competence Certification Effects Scale (CCES) was used, and after a consistency analysis, the original 22 items were reduced to 17, grouped in a 4-factor structure: “Intrinsic Value”; “Certification as Training”; “Career Management”; and “Effort Trade-off”. Cronbach's alphas were .81, .81, .83, and .81, respectively. In short, the findings of the study indicate that there is a significant difference in the perceived usefulness of a certification, if an employee participates or not in a dedicated certification program. This difference is more significant in more senior, management-related roles, as for junior engineers that don't participate in a certification program, this participation isn't seen as a professional development anchor or a valid education driver. The paper presents and discusses the study's main results in points III to V, after describing methodological aspects and the underlying theoretical framework.},

The course structure consists of three parts that aims to improve students' three abilities: learning ability, academic research ability, and innovation ability. For learning ability, multiple usages of searching engines are added to help develop their search quotient. For academic research ability, how to search in many databases and how to manage the literatures are important issues. For innovation ability, how to evaluate innovations and how to manage one's inspirations are included. These three abilities are trained by project assignment that is required in a limited time. A questionnaire is carried out to obtain the feedbacks of participants. The results shed light on that the design of our course achieves good results with high satisfaction degree. It shows that the proposed course structure is very welcome and it has promising applications in other majors.},

abstract={Studying examples of working code is an excellent way for users of advanced computing resources to understand how to complete a task given a set of resources, constraints and goals. Expert users are adept at searching the Internet for examples that they can use or modify, yet novices can be easily overwhelmed by the quantity and variety of examples available online. Even when a relevant example has been found, it often must be modified in order for the user to use it on a particular advanced computing resource (HPC). Copied examples often fail to work at first, and it can be difficult for novice users to understand the problem: are they using the example incorrectly? Is the example itself broken? Or is the example correct but the parameters need to be adjusted for the specific system being used? This paper presents a simple solution to this challenge: a “getexample” utility that allows users to access working examples of how to complete a variety of tasks on a specific HPC system. While getexample was designed for an HPC system that relies on a command line interface, variations on this theme could easily be developed for other interfaces and resources.},

This understanding and "computational thinking" is deepened when they encounter the concepts in different contexts and environments, as opposed to only in one traditional programming language. In this paper, we describe how we used the Cinco Adventure Game Tool, a tool that allows students to model simple browser games in an intuitive graphical framework, to train basic computational concepts in a creative and engaging, learning-by-doing fashion. On purpose, we steered away from traditional programming languages, in order to separate the use of the concepts and constructs from the hurdle of a programming language syntax and development environment. The experiences with a large group of first-term Computer Science students in two successive years were very positive: The students had no problems in understanding and using the concepts, used the tool proficiently and enjoyed designing and modelling the games. Working together on a game project in small groups, they showed sustained engagement, developed a high level of confidence, and created quite complex games containing various fundamental computational constructs.},

abstract={Novice programmers struggle with the complex syntax of modern programming languages like Java, and make lot of syntax errors. The diagnostic syntax error messages from compilers and IDEs are sometimes useful, but often the messages are cryptic and puzzling. Novices could be helped, and instructors' time saved, by automated repair suggestions when dealing with syntax errors. Large samples of novice errors and fixes are now available, offering the possibility of data-driven machine-learning approaches to help novices fix syntax errors. Current machine-learning approaches do a reasonable job fixing syntax errors in shorter programs, but don't work as well even for moderately longer programs. We introduce SynShine, a machine-learning based tool that substantially improves on the state-of-the-art, by learning to use compiler diagnostics, employing a very large neural model that leverages unsupervised pre-training, and relying on multi-label classification rather than autoregressive synthesis to generate the (repaired) output. We describe SynShine's architecture in detail, and provide a detailed evaluation. We have built SynShine into a free, open-source version of Visual Studio Code (VSCode); we make all our source code and models freely available.},

abstract={The rapid changes in the electronics industry have resulted in a reduced dependence on discrete components in circuit design. This change requires a review of the "traditional" breadboarding associated with the sophomore/junior level networks/electronics laboratory courses. A review of available software, and software under development, reveals that much of the circuit construction normally associated with these laboratory courses can now be done on a personal computer. This paper will present a discussion of a new pilot program under development in the Bradley Department of Electrical Engineering that will "connect" the senior level elective microelectronics design sequence with the introductory (sophomore/junior) level networks and electronics laboratories. The new program is designed to address some of these changes in the electronics area by providing a supply of "integrated" circuit components, devices, and modules for use in the sophomore/junior level laboratories that are produced as part of the senior microelectronics design sequence.},

title={Evaluation and assessment of effects on exploring mutation testing in programming courses},
year={2015},
volume={},
number={},
pages={1-9},
abstract={Mutation analysis is a testing strategy that consists of using supporting tools to seed artificial faults in the original code of a software under test, generating faulty programs (“mutants”) that are supposed to produce incorrect outputs. Novice programmers suffer of a wide range of deficits due to defective training processes. We argue that the incorporation of experiences on mutation testing in programming courses adds valuable knowledge to the learning process. In this paper we evaluate the effects of using mutation testing to improve the learning process of students in programming courses. We present results of experiments and analysis involving undergraduate students. These experiments are the continuation of a previous work in which we raise empirical evidences that the adequate incorporation of mutation testing in programming courses contributes to form an effective environment that fosters learning. To do so, we provide a mutation testing tool to promote the practice of mutation testing by novice programmers. Through practical experiences and several analysis survey we measured the effects of using the mutation testing criterion to teach programming. In addition, we collected the opinion of senior students who already knew mutation testing concepts about their opinion on the usage of mutation concepts to teach novice programmers. Our findings reveal that the effective use of mutation analysis concepts contributes to the learning process, making students see the code as a product under development that is the result of a careful manual coding process which they need for measuring and predicting the effect of each command. The main contributions discussed in this paper are: (1) presenting results of an empirical analysis involving undergraduate students, thus giving us preliminary evidence on the effects of the novel practice; (2) exposing possible practices to explore mutation testing in programming classes, highlighting the limitations and strengths of such strategy; and (3) a mutation testing tool for educational purposes.},

abstract={This paper reviews three cases of information seeking environment within Brazilian KIBS (knowledge intensive based services) companies aiming to present how experts (or people with greater expertise) use or fail to use information technology to generate metaknowledge (or knowledge about knowledge). We are concerned about the differences between the perspective of information seeking from an expert in regard to a novice, but by considering other intermediate degrees of capability as well. In general, access to information is performed by using Knowledge Management Systems in order to searching within the organizational database, however, even the "information" remains stored into a datawarehouse, the metaknowledge produced from this interaction belongs only to the user. So if the user has enough expertise, the use of any information system comes to be obsolete. Thus, through the observation of the expert's behavior, we suggest and test a model for diminish that problem. Results demonstrate that the efficiency in the use of a computer system depends largely on the requirements of experts and their relationships with the people involved in developing such systems. Even, our model remains as a theoretical approach it suggest a basis for a software engineering to develop a customized Knowledge Management Systems for underpin the research problem.},

abstract={Function recognition in program binaries serves as the foundation for many binary instrumentation and analysis tasks. However, as binaries are usually stripped before distribution, function information is indeed absent in most binaries. By far, identifying functions in stripped binaries remains a challenge. Recent research work proposes to recognize functions in binary code through machine learning techniques. The recognition model, including typical function entry point patterns, is automatically constructed through learning. However, we observed that as previous work only leverages syntax-level features to train the model, binary obfuscation techniques can undermine the pre-learned models in real-world usage scenarios. In this paper, we propose FID, a semantics-based method to recognize functions in stripped binaries. We leverage symbolic execution to generate semantic information and learn the function recognition model through well-performing machine learning techniques.FID extracts semantic information from binary code and, therefore, is effectively adapted to different compilers and optimizations. Moreover, we also demonstrate that FID has high recognition accuracy on binaries transformed by widely-used obfuscation techniques. We evaluate FID with over four thousand test cases. Our evaluation shows that FID is comparable with previous work on normal binaries and it notably outperforms existing tools on obfuscated code.},

However, choosing proper chord sequences to accompany a melody is difficult for novices, which requires the knowledge of musical structure and harmony. The paper proposes a novel method to generate chords matching a given melody using the model CLSTMS that combines two LSTM models. One model focuses on the relationship between measure notes information and corresponding chord, the other explores chord transfer rules. Experiments show that after trained on the lead sheet database, CLSTMS can learn certain principles of composing, and the performance is better than traditional HMM from the perspective of repetition rate.},

abstract={The construction industry accounts for a high number of accidents. Although identifying hazards before construction starts or during construction is widely employed to prevent accidents, it typically fails because of insufficient safety experience. The experience helps in training novice inspectors, although extracting and describing tacit knowledge explicitly is difficult. This study created a 3-D virtual construction site, and designed a hazard-identification experiment involving 14 hazards (e.g., falls, collapses, and electric shocks), and an eye-tracker was used to compare the search patterns of the experienced and novice workers. The results indicated that experience assisted the experienced workers in assessing hazards significantly faster than the novice workers could; however, it did not improve the accuracy with which they identified hazards, indicating that general work experience is not equivalent to safety-specific experience, and may not necessarily improve workers' accuracy in identifying hazards. Nevertheless, the experienced workers were more confident in identifying hazards, they exhibited fewer fixations.},

abstract={Users at different levels of domain experience have very different needs. For example, a system designed to assist domain novices may frustrate experts and vice-versa. This is one of several challenges specific to building decision support systems for experience-centered domains. A second challenge in working with complex experience-centered domains is that it is hard for non-experts to understand the domain in order to model it. In this paper we present DAISY, the design aid for intelligent support systems. It is a software design methodology for constructing decision support systems in complex, experience-based domains. DAISY address the specialized challenges of these domains by augmenting existing cognitive engineering methodologies. In particular, DAISY provides a method for identifying the specialized needs of users within a specific range of domain experience. Thus, it can help software designers to understand "What does the domain expert need?" or "What does a trained novice need?" To help system designers manage the complexity of modeling unfamiliar experience-centered domains, it provides a tool called a time/activity matrix. To illustrate each of DAISY's steps, we used the development of a decision support system called Fox. Fox assists expert military planners by rapidly generating alternative plans. This is a cognitively difficult, time critical task with life and death consequences.},

We illustrate the use of SEAM for Enterprise Architecture with an example in which a new hiring process and an IT system are developed. With this approach it is possible to train new engineers in the design of business and IT alignment. It is also possible to scope projects in a way that integrate both business and IT strategies.

abstract={Provided with evolved functionalities, a digestive endoscopy atlas can be used as a training tool and even as a diagnostic aid for "junior" endoscopists. Next to a classic illustration of diagnoses by means of noteworthy iconography, such an atlas must in addition integrate similar cases retrieval and diagnostic hypothesis evaluation. That is precisely the main reason why a Case Based Reasoning (CBR), organized around two bases, one of endoscopic knowledge and one of case iconography, is well adapted to the objectives; actually, the CBR cycle-new case description, similar erases retrieval, knowledge base correction and new case training-allows one to conceive a system able to improve. This paper focuses on the creation of two bases, in other words, the knowledge representation and the iconography indexing. The concept of Scenes with Objects is useful to describe the endoscopic diagnoses as well as the images or sequences of the cases. The endoscopic diagnosis description obviously falls within the province of an expert. He/she generally prefers to express uncertainty and vagueness in a qualitative form rather than in a quantitative one. So, merging Rough Set Theory and Qualitative Theory of Uncertainty appears to be an unexplored but promising way in order to elaborate a Knowledge Based System. Moreover, thanks to description common mode, the knowledge base takes the place of thesaurus valuable to the cases indexing. Likewise, the elaborated knowledge representation and indexing open some tracks towards the similar ease retrieval.},

In any IT industry, it is not that easy stuff to keep up with solution delivery and meet ever-changing requirements of client without a proper plan. `Kanban' can easily work here, which requires strong team building. On top of it when inter departmental or cross track teams involved, it becomes little dicey to monitor delivery also it leads to dependency. Therefore, at the level of `Program Management' we need a more sophisticated model to deal with those challenges. Right now there is no any such model exists which will be useful on the program management level. This paper describes that framework called `Scaled Agile' to improve the process and productivity.},

abstract={Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) is a prerequisite for board certification in general surgery in the USA. In FLS, the suturing task with intracorporeal knot tying is considered the most complex task. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been shown to facilitate FLS surgical skill acquisition where 2mA tDCS for 15min with the anode over F3 (10/10 EEG montage) and cathode over F4 has improved performance score in an open knot-tying task. Since PFC has a functional organization related to the hierarchy of cognitive control, we performed functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to investigate PFC sub-domain activation during a more complex FLS suturing task with intracorporeal knot tying. We performed fNIRS-based analysis using AtlasViewer software on two expert surgeons and four novice medical students. We found an average cortical activation mainly at the left frontopolar PFC across the experts, while the average cortical activation across the novices was primarily at the left pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus and ventral premotor cortex, inferior parietal lobule, and supramarginal gyrus. Here, the average cortical activation across the novices included not only the cognitive control related brain regions but also motor control complexity related brain regions. Therefore, we present a computational pipeline to identify a 4x1 high-definition (HD) tDCS montage of motor complexity related PFC sub-regions using ROAST software.Clinical Relevance—A computational pipeline for fNIRS-guided tES to individualize electrode montage that may facilitate FLS surgical training in our future studies.},

abstract={Rope jumping is a popular training method in athletic programs, fitness, and physical education. Forward and backward rope jumping has been used for evaluating athlete’s performance. Both of these two jumps require coordination in the upper and lower limbs. However, no study has focused on movement coordination during forward and backward rope jumping. Relative phase (RP) analysis was widely known as an innovative method for evaluating human movement coordination. Thus we aimed to investigate the movement coordination during forward and backward rope jumping by using RP analysis. 78 elementary and junior high school students participated in this study. 30 seconds rope jumping was recorded for both forward and backward by using iPhone video. Pose estimation software was used for jump motion tacking. Movement coordination was analyzed through RP analysis, absolute maximum value, mean absolute RP, and deviation phase were calculated for evaluating movement coordination, the trend of in or out-of-phase, as well as movement stability. As a result, 3994 forward and 3961 backward jumps were analyzed. There was a significant difference in movement coordination between forward and backward rope jumping. Compared to forward, backward jumps showed worse movement coordination, a trend to be out-of-phase, and less stability. It was the first time that movement coordination during rope jumping was studied. We considered that further research on coordination during rope jumping can provide new insight into athlete performance management, fitness guidance, and physical education.},

abstract={Most novice teachers and even some experienced teachers can lack appropriate tools for designing teaching strategies that ensure the quality of education. The ability of working in teams is crucial in educating professionals. The literature proves that social relations influence the performance of teams. For instance, the team cohesion is directly related with its performance. In this paper, we have developed an agent-based tool for assisting teachers in simulating their teaching strategies to estimate their influence on the group sociometrics like cohesion, coherence of reciprocal relations, dissociation, and density of relations. The experiments with nine scenarios in disciplines of computer science, electronic, psychology, business, tourism, and renewal energies with 239 students and 6 teachers including experienced and novice ones show that its underlying agent-based framework can adapt to different disciplines obtaining similar outcomes to the real ones. We learned that the tool was especially reliable in predicting the density of relations and the cohesion, being the latter one probably the most relevant due to its known relation with academic performance. In addition, we also learned that it was difficult to assess the prediction quality of the dissociation in higher education, due to the usual low amounts or absence of reciprocal rejections in the students' groups in this educational stage. The presented agent-based tool is publicly distributed as open source for facilitating other researchers in following this research line.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: The new technology ensures 3D laparoscopic vision by adding depth to the traditional two dimensions. This realistic vision gives the surgeon the feeling of operating in real space. Hospital of Treviglio-Caravaggio isn't an university or scientific institution; in 2014 a new 3D laparoscopic technology was acquired therefore it led to evaluation of the of the appropriateness in term of patient outcome and safety. The project aims at achieving the development of a quantitative validation model that would ensure low cost and a reliable measure of the performance of 3D technology versus 2D mode. In addition, it aims at demonstrating how new technologies, such as open source hardware and software and 3D printing, could help research with no significant cost increase. For these reasons, in order to define criteria of appropriateness in the use of 3D technologies, it was decided to perform a study to technically validate the use of the best technology in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and safety in the use of a system between laparoscopic vision in 3D and the traditional 2D.METHODS: 30 surgeons were enrolled in order to perform an exercise through the use of laparoscopic forceps inside a trainer. The exercise consisted of having surgeons with different level of seniority, grouped by type of specialization (eg. surgery, urology, gynecology), exercising videolaparoscopy with two technologies (2D and 3D) through the use of a anthropometric phantom. The target assigned to the surgeon was that to pass "needle and thread" without touching the metal part in the shortest time possible. The rings selected for the exercise had each a coefficient of difficulty determined by depth, diameter, angle from the positioning and from the point of view. RESULTS: The analysis of the data collected from the above exercise has mathematically confirmed that the 3D technique ensures a learning curve lower in novice and greater accuracy in the performance of the task with respect to 2D.},

abstract={Robotics is very appealing and is long recognized as a great way to teach programming, while drawing inspiring connections to other branches of engineering and science such as maths, physics or electronics. Although this symbiotic relationship between robotics and programming is perceived as largely beneficial, educational approaches often feel the need to hide the underlying complexity of the robotic system, but as a result fail to transmit the reactive essence of robot programming to the roboticists and programmers of the future. This paper presents ROSY, a novel language for teaching novice programmers through robotics. Its functional style is both familiar with a high-school algebra background and a materialization of the inherent reactive nature of robotic programming. Working at a higher-level of abstraction also teaches valuable design principles of decomposition of robotics software into collections of interacting controllers. Despite its simplicity, ROSY is completely valid Haskell code compatible with the ROS ecosystem. We make a convincing case for our language by demonstrating how non-trivial applications can be expressed with ease and clarity, exposing its sound functional programming foundations, and developing a web-enabled robot programming environment.},

abstract={Although recognized as important, programming style is one aspect commonly neglected by developers. However, follow the pattern of programming presents in a project may be useful to understand and maintain the system. Usually, the companies build their own guidelines for coding bug fixes or new features. Nonetheless, developing this set of rules is not a simple task, and there are even inconsistencies in the specialized literature. Therefore, this paper proposes a new approach to programming style analysis, using a recurrent neural network (RNN) that learns the programming style presents in a project and determines whether a piece of code submitted to it, follows the project's pattern. A study on three real projects was conducted and demonstrated the promising of the approach, by revealing the RNN capability to recognize the programming style pattern of each project.},

abstract={Punching techniques are one of the challenges that martial arts trainers face while training the beginners. In order to teach the punching techniques in a proper way, trainers should constantly comment on the athlete’s performance. In some circumstances the best performing athlete will also perform incorrect punches. The main purpose of this study is to develop a 3D arm GUI to demonstrate the simplest karate punches, known as choku-zuki, performed by participants via wireless communication. The generated 3D image will then be analyzed by comparing the accuracy of the performed punch with an accurate reference and a stable punching pattern retrieved from karate experts. The proposed module is composed of MPU6050 IMU sensors to measure the rotation and angular velocity of wrist, forearm, and upper arm to determine the user’s punch. Then, the proposed system is tested on 10 female and male karate performers to obtain a pattern and 10 female and male newcomers to obtain another pattern. Later, both the data will be used to evaluate the system functionality and illustrate the accuracy of performed punch with respect to pattern. The results showed that the control group could match their punch with the pattern after three attempts. It was also observed that the participants were unable to maintain their performance, as some achieved good results in terms of pattern, but lost accuracy in their second and third attempts. The major issue with newcomers is related to their hand rotation and varying angular velocity.},

abstract={Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that may lead to significant impairment in social communication, repetitive patterns of behavior, and possible fixed and restricted interests. Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is a well-supported and evidence-based treatment for the delays attributed to ASD. Assistive technologies, such as gamification, software apps, computer-based training (Web), and robotics; provide a standardized method of implementing ABA techniques. This review provides a synthesis of the main characteristics of these technologies. The assessed proposals focused on technologies such as Distributed Systems, Image Processing, Gamification, and Robotics. The primary objectives of these tools sought to improve social behavior, attention, communication, and reading skills. Some common limitations found in the literature was a failure to accurately define their target audience, and a failure to comply with the dimensions of ABA as defined by Baer, Wolf, and Risley in 1968.},

abstract={The rapid proliferation of Smart Grids calls for a more in-depth understanding of user energy consumption behaviors, based on large data volumes collected by various sources of sensors such as voltmeter and ammeter. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is a single sensor solution, which can effectively disaggregate individual appliance states from measurements only at the interface to the power source, albeit at the cost of requiring circuit modifications thus introducing suspension of services and potential safety hazards. To overcome the undesirable attribute of NILM and achieve a safe yet highly accurate solution, we devise a contactless sensing system based on inductive current measurements that can conduct load disaggregation without tampering with the power system. Despite using single modality, i.e., the inductive current, our scheme attains state-of-the-art accuracy in existing multi-modality datasets by leveraging modality distillation technique to handle arbitrary input structure. Our main contributions enlist: (1) devising and deploying the first, to the best of our knowledge, purely contactless non-intrusive load disaggregation system; (2) the design of an oracle-apprentice network structure to leverage multi-modality input for training, while operating with single modality; (3) a high estimation accuracy of 95.44% and 96.21%, respectively, is attested on two public datasets, which proves the efficiency of our method.},

abstract={Research productivity is a common issue for university management, especially in most teaching-based universities. This research aims to investigate the various factors contributing to the research productivity of university faculty members through the use of decision tree modeling. Three separate models, each for junior, intermediate, and senior faculty members, were developed to quantitatively predict individual faculty member's publication output in a specific target year. The models were trained and evaluated on a dataset containing academic profiles and past publications of 78 full-time faculty members in Binus University International by using cross-validation. The overall accuracy of the models was above 80%, with the model for the junior faculty members achieved 100% accuracy. Several key findings were identified from this research. First, possession of doctoral degree was found to be a key identifier of productive junior faculty members. Second, length of service with university did not affect research productivity. Third, tenured faculty members were identified to be productive in research after two years of consistent publications.},

abstract={Malware programs attack computer systems, smart mobile devices, and some applications. Malware is a program that needs to be watched out for because it can be a threat to computer users and internet networks. Malware was created to steal personal information about a computer user or control a user’s device over a network. Computers are easily infiltrated by various malware programs that can interfere with and even damage user files. Many users are not aware of the entry of malware programs into a computer, one of which is through a network that contains the malware program. To solve this problem, this study discusses malware detection based on network traffic and classifies these types of networks based on their groups so that they can help detect whether the network contains malware or not. The data used in this study was taken from the Kaggle Data Set, namely the Android Network Traffic Malware with a total of 7845 Data in the form of a CSV file containing a collection of data that has been captured based on traffic on the network that contains malware and does not contain malware. The process of training and testing on the Data Set is carried out using the Rapidminer Tools by making a Binary Classification or creating two classes, namely the malicious class and the benign class. The method used is Machine Learning by comparing the Random Forest Algorithm, Decission Tree and Gradient Boosted Tree. The results obtained from the three algorithms show that Random Forest has the highest level of accuracy.},

This study develops an algorithm for tracking laparoscopy instruments in the video cues of a standard laparoscopy training box with a single webcam camera and proposes new criteria to assess skill level using the extracted tool trajectories. Instrument tracking and assessment criteria together constitute a significant step towards developing a low cost, automated, and widely applicable laparoscopy training and assessment system using a standard physical training box equipped with a webcam. The developed visual tracking algorithm recovers the 3D positions of the laparoscopic instruments tips to which simple colored tapes (markers) are attached. The new assessment criteria are based on frequency analysis and linear discriminant analysis of the 3D reconstructed trajectories of the instruments. The performance of these proposed criteria are compared to the conventional criteria for laparoscopy training and demonstrated to be superior on the data we have recorded from six professional laparoscopy surgeons and ten novice subjects.},

abstract={Extracting and transferring human skills is an important step towards creating an intelligent robot in a cooperative environment. Human skill contains human control skill and human motion skill. Many studies have been done to extract and transfer either human control skill or human motion skill successfully; however, the complete human-to-human skill transfer process (including both human control skill and human motion skill) has not been realized. In this study, the objective is to achieve the complete human-to-human skill transfer process from an expert to a novice. To realize the human control skill extract, synthesis and transfer process, a dynamic simulator is built up to record human operators’ control trajectories. Based on the simulation results, the best control strategy can be obtained. To analyze human motion skill, motion capture equipment is employed to record human operators’ motions, and BvhViewer software is utilized to compute human joint angle values. To make human novices understand human experts’ motions easily, it is absolutely necessary to reproduce and synthesize the experts’ motions. In this case, a kinematic human body simulator is utilized to synthesize the experts’ motions. A ball shooting task is employed to evaluate the effect of the proposed method. The results show that, after training by the synthesized human control skill model and the human motion skill model, the novice’s performance is significantly improved.},

abstract={The use of digital twins to represent a product or process digitally is trending in many engineering disciplines. This term has also been recently introduced in the medical field. In arthroscopic surgery education, the paradigm shift from apprenticeship to simulation training has driven the need for better simulators, and the current focus is on improving simulators with respect to computational efficiency and system accuracy. However, expanding surgical simulations towards digital twins has not yet been explored. This paper introduces the digital twin concept for arthroscopic surgery, and explores its potential in light of the existing scientific literature. Thus, a systematic review was conducted to summarize and analyze the literature with respect to fast and robust design of an arthroscopic digital twin using patient-specific information, and methods for interactive surgical soft tissue simulation. The review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol with three reliable scientific search engines: IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect and PubMed. Eighty papers were included in the review, and the extracted data included modeling methods, tissue types, constitutive behavior, computational efficiency or accuracy, hardware configuration, haptic device description, software tools, and system architectures. Considering the review, a novel macro-level conceptual arthroscopic digital twin system is presented, and the applicability of the review findings for the identified subsystems are discussed. The proposed system integrates patient-specific images, diagnostic data, intraoperative sensor data, and surgical practice as inputs, and conceptually enables surgical skills training, preoperative planning, and a database of virtual surgeries.},

We report data obtained with an overall fluence of $3.41\times {10^{12}} {\mathrm {n/cm}}^{2}$ for atmospheric neutrons (equivalent to more than 30 million years of natural irradiation) and of $7.55\times {10^{12}} {\mathrm {n/cm}}^{2}$ for thermal neutrons. We evaluate the behavior of TPUs executing elementary operations with increasing input sizes (standard convolutions or depthwise convolutions) as well as eight convolutional neural networks (CNNs) configurations (single-shot multibox detection (SSD) MobileNet v2 and SSD MobileDet, trained with COCO dataset, and Inception v4 and ResNet-50, with ILSVRC2012 dataset). We found that, despite the high error rate, most neutron-induced errors only slightly modify the convolution output and do not change the detection or classification of CNNs. By reporting details about the error model, we provide valuable information on how to design the CNNs to avoid neutron-induced events to lead to misdetections or classifications.},

abstract={This Innovative Practice of a Full Paper presents new ways of teaching classes. The teaching methodology of the algorithm disciplines of the first years of Computer Engineering courses directly affects student performance throughout the course. The current education system is in transition, taking slow steps in new ways of learning. By promoting self-reflection and critical thinking, students can develop problem-solving skills and observe an application of the tools learned. A proposed methodology includes new structuring of the discipline "Algorithms and Data Structures I" at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande (FURG), with the learning of a modern programming language and the transformation of the classic classroom model to new methods and dynamics. Computational thinking is fundamental at the beginning of the course. From this, all students receive a introduction course at the beginning of the college year to immerse in dynamics to practice logic. Classes began, students received an extension to the basic learning of the discipline (the fundamentals of algorithms and Python as a modern programming language) and at the same time they received an assignment, a problem resolution, where they had space and time to develop a game with the theme of their choice. The activity requires teamwork and creativity. As lectures run as workshops, allowing collaboration and project creation, with the help of teachers and older students as tutors. To complete the program, an event made available by the university was used as an environment, for visitors, scholars as well for high school juniors interested in software, to attend and learn about. As a preliminary result of the new implementation methodology, after 4 years, there was an increase in the approval and average grade of learners.},

abstract={Recently, Blockchain technology has gained considerable attention from researchers and practitioners. This is mainly due to its unique features including decentralization, security, reliability, and data integrity. Despite this increasing interest, little is recognized and that over existing notion of knowledge and experience concerning the usages of Blockchain technology in education. The whole paper is a comparative study on Blockchain-based educational software. It concentrates on three major concepts: (1) academic apps formed with Blockchain, (2) the advantages which could be brought to learning by blockchain and approaches for implementing blockchain innovation in schools and (3) issues. A thorough review of the outcomes of every framework is carried out, as far as a thorough review is focused on the observations. The analysis also provides visibility into certain aspects of learning, which has been gained through blockchain innovation. During the past few years, the issue of funding small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) seems to have been a challenge for emerging nations in particular the Financial regions in developed countries and growing economies have often formed specialized target economies primarily reserved for SMEs in current history. The development about such enough prime businesses devoted to small and mediumsized enterprises is increasingly viewed as an option to the prevailing new investment. Financial leverage has grown differently in emerging markets yet certain issues continue unresolved. Blockchain has significant possibilities in the business sector. While such innovation will not be manipulated or interfered upon, it might be a benefit for junior market indexes although it is a reliable, effective and low-cost method for registering goods and purchase of commodities. Consequently, Blockchain technology optimizes the payment of funds and exchange of equity by mentoring the purchases among small and medium-sized enterprises or startups and shareholders.},

abstract={A “sign” on a lung CT image refers to a radiologic finding that suggests a pathological progression of some specific disease. Analysis of CT signs is helpful to understand the pathological origin of the lesion. In-depth study of lung nodules classification with different CT signs will help to distinguish benign and malignant nodules more clearly and accurately. To this end, we propose an Inception module-based ensemble classification method for pulmonary nodule diagnosis with different nodule signs. We first construct a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier adopting Inception modules and pre-train it on ImageNet. We then fine-tune this pre-trained classifier on 10 different lung nodule sign sample sets, and fuse these 10 classifiers with an artificial immune ensemble algorithm. The overall sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of our proposed Artificial Immune Algorithm-based Inception Networks Fusion (AIA-INF) algorithm are 82.22%, 93.17%, and 88.67%, respectively, which are significantly higher than those of the alternative Bagging and Boosting methods. The experimental results show that our Inception-based ensemble classifier offers promising performance, and compared with other CADx systems, this scheme can offer a more detailed reference for diagnosis, and can be valuable for junior radiologist training.},

This paper discusses the implementation of the "Smarter Car" that relies on low-resolution camera images of the racetrack for training a neural net off-line for car position and road curvature. A fuzzy controller determines the required steering action to keep the car on the track. This paper illustrates how neural nets that were software trained can be implemented in an off-the-shelf Motorola 68HC11 embedded microprocessor system. Even though just one specific example is illustrated in detail, this approach is generic and can be readily extended for the implementation of similar systems such as the control of robot arms and more general industrial neural net and fuzzy logic applications.},

abstract={Introduction: Teaching autonomous driving is a challenging task. Indeed, most existing autonomous driving teaching activities focus on a few of the technologies involved. This not only fails to provide a comprehensive coverage, but also sets a high entry barrier for students with different backgrounds. Objective: The primary objective of this study is to present a modular, integrated approach towards teaching autonomous driving. Methods: We organize the technologies used in autonomous driving into modules. This is described in the textbook we have developed as well as a series of multimedia online lectures designed to provide technical overview for each module. Once the students have understood these modules, the experimental platforms for integration we have developed allow the students to fully understand how the modules interact with each other. Results: To verify this teaching approach, we present three case studies: an introductory class on autonomous driving for students with only a basic technology background; a new session in an existing embedded systems class to demonstrate how embedded system technologies can be applied towards autonomous driving; and an industry professional training session to quickly bring up experienced engineers to work in autonomous driving. The results show that students can maintain a high interest level and make great progress by starting with familiar concepts before moving onto other modules. Conclusions: Autonomous driving is not one single technology, but rather a complex system integrating many technologies. Our modular and integrated approach is an effective method in teaching autonomous driving.},

For the African continent, this movement presents a real opportunity for development with multiple impacts on the economy, education, the inclusion of youth and women, training and entrepreneurship. Several FabLabs have been created on the continent. The purpose of this study is to take stock of the situation of existing FabLabs and to make a strategic analysis of their operation thanks to the SWOT analysis. Information gathered by interview and questionnaires allowed to identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of these FabLabs. The qualitative analysis method was used to process the answers on the SWOT questions. This study can be used as a reference to help existing FabLabs better chart their strategy, give them a vision, and set more consistent goals for their actions. The results of the study can also be used by newcomers, organizations wishing to launch a FabLab in Africa.},

abstract={A graphical user interface (GUI) for heterogeneous neural network simulators proposed in this article is intended to be of use both for the novice and for the experienced neural network user. For the novice, it provides an easy-to-use neural network simulation package that insulates the user from the requirements of knowing the simulator implementation details or the configuration file syntax. For the experienced neural network professional it provides an interface that is easily extensible to include any additional neural network simulator in its binary form. To satisfy both academic and personal computer environments, the GUI has been developed by using the free TCL/TK software package, available on workstations running Unix and on PCs running the free Linux operating system. Although the GUI and the embedded simulators have been successfully tested both in neural network research and training programs, a more extensive testing in undergraduate and graduate level classes is in progress.},

Twenty-eight undergraduate students of an Informatics Engineering program were trained in usability and heuristic evaluations for this purpose. They were asked to perform a heuristic evaluation of a transactional Web site. A survey was taken in order to capture their perceptions about the usability heuristics. The design of the survey was focused on determining evaluators' perceptions about six dimensions: ease of use, usefulness, clarity, checklist necessity, intention to use and completeness. Analyzing the results, we could determine that all the above mentioned constructs have an influence in the intention to use the heuristics in future usability evaluations, excepting the perceived clarity. Based on the obtained results, a perception-based model of the usability heuristics is presented.},

pages={311-322},
abstract={Syntax errors are made by novice and experienced programmers alike; however, novice programmers lack the years of experience that help them quickly resolve these frustrating errors. Standard LR parsers are of little help, typically resolving syntax errors and their precise location poorly. We propose a methodology that locates where syntax errors occur, and suggests possible changes to the token stream that can fix the error identified. This methodology finds syntax errors by using language models trained on correct source code to find tokens that seem out of place. Fixes are synthesized by consulting the language models to determine what tokens are more likely at the estimated error location. We compare n-gram and LSTM (long short-term memory) language models for this task, each trained on a large corpus of Java code collected from GitHub. Unlike prior work, our methodology does not rely that the problem source code comes from the same domain as the training data. We evaluated against a repository of real student mistakes. Our tools are able to find a syntactically-valid fix within its top-2 suggestions, often producing the exact fix that the student used to resolve the error. The results show that this tool and methodology can locate and suggest corrections for syntax errors. Our methodology is of practical use to all programmers, but will be especially useful to novices frustrated with incomprehensible syntax errors.},

abstract={For effective tremor compensation in robotics assisted hand-held device, accurate filtering of tremulous motion is necessary. The time-varying unknown phase delay that arises due to both software (filtering) and hardware (sensors) in these robotics instruments adversely affects the device performance. In this paper, moving window-based least squares support vector machines approach is formulated for multistep prediction of tremor to overcome the time-varying delay. This approach relies on the kernel-learning technique and does not require the knowledge of prediction horizon compared to the existing methods that require the delay to be known as a priori. The proposed method is evaluated through simulations and experiments with the tremor data recorded from surgeons and novice subjects. Comparison with the state-of-the-art techniques highlights the suitability and better performance of the proposed method.},

abstract={Cyber criminals use phishing emails in high-volume and spear phishing emails in low volume to achieve their malicious objectives. Hereby they inflict financial, reputational, and emotional damages on individuals and organizations. These (spear) phishing attacks get steadily more sophisticated as cyber criminals use social engineering tricks that combine psychological and technical deceptions to make malicious emails as trustworthy as possible. Such sophisticated (spear) phishing emails are hard for email protection systems to detect. Security researchers have studied users' ability to perceive, identify and react upon email (spear) phishing attacks. In this study we have surveyed recent works on understanding how to prevent end-users from falling for email (spear) phishing attacks. Based on the survey we design and propose a novice method that combines interaction methods of reporting, blocking, warning, and embedded education to harness the intelligence of expert and novice users in a corporate environment in detecting email (spear) phishing attacks. We evaluate the design based on a qualitative study, in three experimental steps, by using a mockup prototype, and with 24 participants. We report on the insights gained, indicating that the proposed combination of the interaction methods is promising, and on future research directions.},

year={2020},
volume={},

pages={1-17},
abstract={Since launch, radio science has been a key component of the Juno mission to Jupiter. The prime objective of the radio science investigation is to estimate the gravitational field of Jupiter from the Doppler shift on the radio link between the spacecraft and the Earth-based observing antennas of NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN). In addition to estimation of the gravitational field, radio science has provided critical engineering support to the Juno mission. Utilizing high-sensitivity open-loop receivers and real-time signal processing, radio science is able to detect the ‘heartbeat’ of the Juno spacecraft and determine the current state of the spacecraft. The Juno spacecraft utilizes two frequencies for communication with Earth: the telecommunications system X-band link and the radio science Ka-band link. Radio science has provided communications monitoring support for the spacecraft launch in 2011, spacecraft main engine firings (including Deep Space Maneuvers in 2012 and Jupiter Orbit Insertion in 2016), the Earth gravity assist flyby in 2013, and times when the spacecraft was off-Earth point during Jupiter closest approach with a weak signal level. By measuring the signal-to-noise ratio, received carrier frequency, and subcarrier frequency of the X-band downlink signal in real-time, radio science is able to determine the state of the spacecraft in scenarios where the link margin is not sufficient to support telemetry. An off-nominal spacecraft state will change the signal-to-noise level, subcarrier frequency, and spin modulation of the carrier frequency which are detectable in the open-loop receiver of the DSN. With the addition of multiple frequency shift keying (MFSK) ‘tones’ encoding, the subcarrier frequency can be changed onboard the spacecraft for determination of selected events by the flight team. Tones were utilized during main engine firings on Juno, including Jupiter Orbit Insertion (JOI). Tones are decoded in near real-time by the Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) Data Analysis (EDA) system downstream of the DSN open-loop receivers. Robust implementation of hardware, software, and operations planning has ensured successful data collection and real-time status reporting of spacecraft state to the Juno mission. Lessons learned from communicating with Juno in this way while in the harsh environment of Jupiter are documented and discussed in the context of upcoming missions to Jupiter.},

abstract={Custom closets customers usually lack the expertise to design their desired closet. The use of a software tool that incorporates the design expertise might allow them to sketch their ideas without third party oversight. While architecture related applications are very powerful and make it possible to have an accurate graphical representation of real world, these Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools demand high technical training and their use in the engineering field is generic. Our work, framed within the development of a rapid prototyping tool of custom closets called Sketch Arm, introduces an interaction proposal that seeks to minimize the time and complexity associated with typical operations in CAD. Supported by multi-touch capabilities of today's mobile devices, our system allows users to manipulate the closet structure directly in real time by using a minimalist graphical user interface (GUI) together with a touch interface based on easily recognizable gesture patterns. Direct on-screen data manipulation is very attractive to the end-user in general and highly beneficial for novice IT users in particular while gesture-based interaction is extremely intuitive for performing artistic tasks. Throughout the article, we will describe in depth the designed interaction system and we will present the original solutions we made to common problems in touch systems like accuracy and occlusion.},

abstract={Mentoring is traditionally viewed as a dyadic, top-down apprenticeship. This perspective, however, overlooks other forms of informal mentoring taking place in everyday activities in which developers invest time and effort. Here, we investigate informal mentoring taking place in Open Source Software (OSS). We define a specific type of informal mentoring - implicit mentoring - situations where contributors guide others through instructions and suggestions embedded in everyday (OSS) activities. We defined implicit mentoring by first performing a review of related work on mentoring, and then through formative interviews with OSS contributors and member-checking. Next, through an empirical investigation of Pull Requests (PRs) in 37 Apache Projects, we built a classifier to extract implicit mentoring. Our analysis of 107,895 PRs shows that implicit mentoring does occur through code reviews (27.41% of all PRs included implicit mentoring) and is beneficial for both mentors and mentees. We analyzed the impact of implicit mentoring on OSS contributors by investigating their contributions and learning trajectories in their projects. Through an online survey (N=231), we then triangulated these results and identified the potential benefits of implicit mentoring from OSS contributors' perspectives. © 2022 ACM.},

abstract={The ability of an Open Source Software (OSS) project to attract, onboard, and retain any newcomer is vital to its livelihood. Although, evidence suggests an upsurge in novice developers joining social coding platforms (such as GitHub), the extent to which their activities result in a OSS contribution is unknown. Henceforth, we execute the protocols of a registered report to study activities of a “Newcomer OSS-Candidate”, who is a novice developer that is new to that social coding platform, and has the intention to later onboard an OSS project. Using GitHub as a case platform, we analyze 171 identified Newcomer OSS-Candidates to characterize their contribution activities. Results show that Newcomer OSS-Candidates are likely to target software based repositories (i.e., 66%), and their first contributions are mainly associated with development (commits) and maintenance (PRs). Newcomer OSS-Candidates are less likely to practice social coding, but eventually end up onboarding (i.e., 30% quantitative, 70% follow-up survey) an OSS project. Furthermore, they cite finding a way to start as the most challenging barrier to contribute. Our work reveals insights on how newcomers to social coding platforms are potential sources of OSS contributions. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={The IT Industry has seen an era of significant attrition which impedes its growth in the most suitable economy for technology businesses. To cater to the issue of high attrition and attract the best talent, one key aspect could be leveraging its entry-level training program for new joiners (Engineers Non-engineers). The purpose of this paper is to explain the importance of leveraging training programs for better Employer Branding to retain and attract talent in the era of high attrition and competition. This paper is based on primary research on current branding practices of the IT companies in India and the choice of employer survey for the entry-level talent pool. The authors studied the Employer Branding strategies of various IT organizations in the country to compare and assess their USPs and the practices in place, which may give them a competitive advantage. The authors have identified how the training programs can be structured to promise career growth to the employees and help the industry build a strong talent pool. The authors have also proposed a Six-factor model for Entry level talent programs in IT companies that outlines the hygiene factors and motivators to attract the best talent and make the company their choice of employer. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={Novice programmers struggle with the complex syntax of modern programming languages like <sc>Java</sc>, and make lot of syntax errors. The diagnostic syntax error messages from compilers and IDEs are sometimes useful, but often the messages are cryptic and puzzling. Novices could be helped, and instructors&#x0027; time saved, by automated repair suggestions when dealing with syntax errors. Large samples of novice errors and fixes are now available, offering the possibility of data-driven machine-learning approaches to help novices fix syntax errors. Current machine-learning approaches do a reasonable job fixing syntax errors in shorter programs, but don&#x0027;t work as well even for moderately longer programs. We introduce <sc>SynShine</sc>, a machine-learning based tool that substantially improves on the state-of-the-art, by learning to use compiler diagnostics, employing a very large neural model that leverages unsupervised pre-training, and relying on multi-label classification rather than autoregressive synthesis to generate the (repaired) output. We describe <sc>SynShine</sc>&#x0027;s architecture in detail, and provide a detailed evaluation. We have built <sc>SynShine</sc> into a free, open-source version of Visual Studio Code (VSCode); we make all our source code and models freely available. IEEE},

abstract={In programming exercises for novice learners, the learners often satisfied with that their programs 'work' at a first glance, and they neglect to test the programs work properly. Making test cases and modifying programs are necessary training for the learners to comprehend behavior of the programs. Therefore, we propose a method for learning programming using test-first approach and a system to support it. Test-first approach is an approach for programming that a programmer makes tests before making programs. Therefore, we decided to apply the approach to the exercises in order to get the learners in habit of testing their programs. The system supports the learners to make test cases and evaluate them. When a learner submits her/his test cases for a question, the system points out missing test cases and gives hints based on a correct answer by a teacher. When the learner submits her/his program, the system executes the tests made by the learner and the teacher and displays the results. This paper describes the method, system, and a preliminary experiment to evaluate the system. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={The goal of knowledge quality improving of secondary school students in the field of exact sciences determines the relevance of creating interactive electronic educational resources for tasks solving of mathematical models programming. The paper presents the electronic textbook description, its content and structure, model, as well as design and software development technology. It is intended to improve qualitatively the preparation of high school students and junior university students in mathematics and programming. In particular, it can be used as a textbook at elective classes and young programmers’ clubs, as well as in the process of individual work to train schoolchildren and students for programming Olympiads. The content of the electronic textbook is based on a set of mathematical tasks. Each task contains a statement of the task, instructions for its solution and an algorithm for solving it, implemented in the form of program code in Pascal, C/C++ and Python. The model of learning system using an electronic training manual is described. The e-tutorial software is a Web application and is built on client-server architecture. The basis of the Web-application is the “Textbook” software module, which contains a complex of mathematical tasks with the author’s algorithms of solving. The web application contains a software module for expanding the electronic textbook content in the form of a built-in editor for mathematical tasks. A qualified user of the system has the opportunity to develop new tasks within the existing textbook format with a description of the algorithm for their solution. The automatic system of checking the proposed algorithm for task solving provides the basis for an expert opinion on placing a new task in the library for further use. The approbation of the Web-application in the educational process was carried out in secondary educational institutions of Kherson, and it received a positive assessment from students and teachers. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The Xacro XML macro language can be used to augment the Universal Robot Description Format (URDF) and is part of a critical toolchain from geometric representations to simulation, visualization, and system execution. However, mem-bers of the robotics community, especially newcomers, struggle to troubleshoot and understand the interplay between systems and the Xacro preprocessing pipeline. To better understand how system developers struggle with Xacros, we manually examine 712 Xacro-related questions from the question and answer site answers.ros.org and find Xacro misunderstandings fit into eight key categories using a systematic, qualitative approach called Open Coding. By examining the 'tags' applied to questions, we further find that Xacro problems manifest in a befuddlingly broad set of contexts. This hinders onboarding and complicates system developers' understanding of representations and tools in the Robot Operating System. We aim to provide an empirical grounding that identifies and prioritizes impediments to users of open robotics systems, so that tool designers, teachers, and robotics practitioners can devise ways of improving robot software tooling and education. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={Participation in Open Source Software (OSS) projects offers real software development experience for students and other newcomers seeking to develop their skills. However, onboarding to an OSS project brings various challenges, including finding a suitable task among various open issues. Selecting an appropriate starter task requires newcomers to identify the skills needed to solve a project issue and avoiding tasks too far from their skill set. However, little is known about how effective newcomers are in identifying the skills needed to resolve an issue. We asked 154 undergrad students to evaluate issues from OSS projects and infer the skills needed to contribute. Students reported a total of 94 skills, which we classified into 10 categories. We compared the students' answers to those collected from 6 professional developers. In general, students misidentified and missed several skills (f-measure=0.37). Students had results closer to professional developers for skills related to database, operating infrastructure, programming concepts, and programming language, and they had worse results in identifying skills related to debugging and program comprehension. Our results can help educators who seek to use OSS as part of their courses and OSS communities that want to label newcomer-friendly issues to facilitate onboarding of new contributors. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={The Robot Operating System (ROS) was initially introduced to lower the barriers to robots software development by reducing the need for extensive domain knowledge. ROS allows developers to build valuable robots by configuring and reusing off-the-shelf components while writing little, if any, code through its modular design, loosely coupled architecture, and rich package ecosystem. However, despite the advantages of this approach, the lack of documentation can present a challenge to novice users. In this work, we discuss the challenges and experience of learning and using ROS from the perspective of three novice users with little to no prior experience in robotics. We report on the experiences in learning ROS through a popular commercial training course provided by The Construct Sim. Through our analysis, we identify several common misunderstandings, mistakes, and bugs, and we outline possible improvements to ROS to overcome these challenges. Our findings motivate further studies on the development of robotic systems in ROS by novice users and promote the improvement of the ROS ecosystem, on educational and training materials of ROS, and on tooling development to help novices identify and correct simple mistakes. © 2022 ACM.},

abstract={Onboarding (i.e., the process of incorporating new people) is relevant because it introduces employees to their role, the company’s culture, and what the company has to offer. Onboarding is then dependent on the company’s culture and practices. When it comes to software development, these practices include the methods, the tools or the developers’ organigram. Accordingly, there is not a one-size-fits-all onboarding, rather this procedure needs to be tuned for the practice at hand. This work tackles the specifics brought about by Software Product Line Engineering w.r.t. traditional software development, namely: larger code base, larger code variability, and larger and more heterogeneous teams. Specifically, this works advocates for feature-centric onboarding. Features (i.e., functional characteristics that are visible for a user) already play a key role throughout the SPL lifecycle. In this context, we advocate for defining the onboarding process as a journey where milestones are equated with features. Unfortunately, finding the most appropriate feature for a newcomer, if conducted manually by mentors, would be time-consuming, given the sheer number of features. To face this problem, we advocate for Recommender Systems based on the similarity between the feature’s codebase and the code previously explored by the newcomer. To this end, we resort to Topic Modeling, and specifically, Latent Dirichlet Allocation. We provide proof-of-concept through RecomMentor, a recommender system for pure-variants as the variability management system. RecomMentor is put to test against ranking metrics of the Information Retrieval literature. The first evaluation suggests that LDA could be an appropriate technique, paving the way towards using Recommender Systems in feature-based onboarding scenarios. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={IT-Security Tabletop Games for developers have been available in analog format; with the COVID-19 pandemic, interest in collaborative remote security games has increased. In this paper, we propose a methodology to evaluate the impact of a (remote) security game-based intervention on developers. The study design consists of the respective intervention, three questionnaires, and a small open interview guide for a focus group. A validated self-efficacy scale is used as a proxy for measuring effects on participants' ability to develop secure software. We tested this design with 9 participants (expert and novice developers and security experts) as part of a small feasibility study to understand the challenges and limitations of remote tabletop games. We describe how we selected and digitalised three security tabletop games, and report the qualitative findings from our evaluation. Setting up and running the virtual tabletop games turned out to be more challenging and complex for both moderator and participants than we expected. Completing the games required patience and persistence, and social interaction was limited. Our findings can be helpful in building and evaluating a better, more comprehensive, technically sound and issue-specific game-based training measure for developers. The methodology can be used by researchers to evaluate existing and new game designs. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={Hackathons are time-bounded collaborative events that typically take between 1 and 3 days of intense teamwork to build prototypes usually in the form of software, aiming to specific challenges proposed by the organizers. These events became a widespread practice in the IT industry, in universities and in many other scenarios, as a result of a growing open-innovation trend in the last decade. Since the main deliverable of these events is a demonstrable version of an idea, such as early hardware or software prototypes, the short time frame requires participants to quickly understand the proposed challenge or even identify issues related to a given domain. To create solutions, teams follow an ad-hoc but effective design approach, that many times seems informal since the background of the participants is rather centered on technical aspects (e.g., web and mobile programming) and does not involve any training in design thinking. To understand this creative process, we conducted a set of 37 interviews with people from 16 countries, consisting of 32 hackathons winners and 5 hackathon organizers. We aimed to identify the design practices (i.e., processes and recurring design methods) that are applied by winners in these types of events. Also, we conducted a focus group with 8 people experienced in hackathons (participants and organizers) to discuss our findings. Our analysis revealed that although hackathon winners with IT background have no formal training in design thinking, they are aware of many design methods and typically follow a sequence of phases that involve divergent and convergent thinking to explore the problem space and propose alternatives in a solution space, which is the rationale behind design thinking. We derived a set of recommendations based on design strategies that seem to lead to successful hackathon participation. These recommendations can also be useful to organizers who intend to enhance the experience of newcomers in hackathons. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Contribution: An intensive three-month educational program can be used for rapid integration of foreign-born people into the IT industry. A novel method for integrating industrial needs with the practical parts of a bachelor's Computer Science program. Background: The program was motivated by (1) the societal need to increase the meaningful integration of immigrants into the workforce, and (2) the demand for IT specialists in the IT labor market. Intended outcomes: An effective intensive software developer program with a high level of industrial integration and a working matching model for employment. Application design: The program consists of three different phases; recruitment of participants, training and job matching. The training is divided into six modules using five different teaching methods. An evaluation model, based on passive and active data, is implemented with fast learning loops for teachers and participants. Findings: The program has been run seven times with 263 unemployed participants of different nationalities. On average 82.6 percent of the participants found employment in the IT industry within 5 months of the course ending. Female participants are in the majority and are more successful in securing employment. The findings suggest that it was possible to rapidly prototype and deliver an advanced reskilling program within a university setting and use it as a positive method to support newcomers find meaningful work that has a direct benefit for the local IT industry, as well as for the wider society. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Context: Agile methods in offshored projects have become increasingly popular. Yet, many companies have found that the use of agile methods in coordination with companies located outside the regions of early agile adopters remains challenging. India has received particular attention as the leading destination of offshoring contracts due to significant cultural differences between sides of such contracts. Alarming differences are primarily rooted in the hierarchical business culture of Indian organizations and related command-and-control management behavior styles. Objective: In this study, we attempt to understand whether cultural barriers persist in distributed projects in which Indian engineers work with a more empowering Swedish management, and if so, how to overcome them. The present work is an invited extension of a conference paper. Method: We performed a multiple-case study in a mature agile company located in Sweden and a more hierarchical Indian vendor. We collected data from five group interviews with a total of 34 participants and five workshops with 96 participants in five distributed DevOps teams, including 36 Indian members, whose preferred behavior in different situations we surveyed. Results: We identified twelve cultural barriers, six of which were classified as impediments to agile software development practices, and report on the manifestation of these barriers in five DevOps teams. Finally, we put forward recommendations to overcome the identified barriers and emphasize the importance of cultural training, especially when onboarding new team members. Conclusions: Our findings confirm previously reported behaviors rooted in cultural differences that impede the adoption of agile approaches in offshore collaborations, and identify new barriers not previously reported. In contrast to the existing opinion that cultural characteristics are rigid and unchanging, we found that some barriers present at the beginning of the studied collaboration disappeared over time. Many offshore members reported behaving similarly to their onshore colleagues. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Understanding how to best support and train novice programmers is a critical component of producing better and more diverse software engineers. In this paper, we present the results of a controlled 11-week longitudinal study with 57 CS1 students comparing two skill-based interventions to improve programming performance. The first intervention involves spatial training, an established baseline known to be helpful in engineering contexts. The second intervention is a novel CS-focused technical reading training. In our reading training, we teach strategies for summarizing scientific papers and understanding scientific charts and figures; most of the covered readings were CS1-accessible portions of computer science research papers. For the spatial training, we use a standardized training curriculum previously found to improve programming skills by focusing on spatial ability (i.e., the ability to mentally manipulate objects). We first replicate findings that both reading ability and spatial ability correlate with programming success. Significantly, however, we find that those in our reading training exhibit larger programming ability gains than those in the standard spatial training (p = 0.02, f2=0.10). We also find that reading trained participants perform particularly well on programming problems that require tracing through code (p = 0.03, f2=0.10). Our results suggest that technical reading training could be beneficial for novice programmers. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for future CS1 interventions, the possibility for non-programming based training to positively impact developers, and future directions for software engineering education research. © 2021 ACM.},

abstract={At our university, the ECE department has striven over the last few years to provide undergraduate students with an educational experience that far exceeds the expectations of hiring managers. We surveyed students and employers to understand where the gap exists between new graduates and highly qualified engineers. New graduates frequently struggled at attaining the best internships. Even before they graduated, many of them started to seek out opportunities but often in vain. Furthermore, most new hires had to go through a season of training before they could become contributing employees. As a result, we wanted to design a course that would help us address the research question: “How can we deliver an engineering education that provides students the skills they need to succeed in the workforce?” By genuinely listening, we discovered a number of key insights which led to a highly successful course where students rapidly design hardware and software to interface with the world. In this paper, we discuss our motivations, the design of the course, what we have learned from teaching the course, and where we see the future of experiential education heading, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for highly effective remote instruction. We believe that the model we have created in this classroom experience successfully prepares students for the rigors of an engineering career. Our ECE department has a rich history of exemplary theoretical teaching, with a strong emphasis on research, but undergraduate students felt a void in how to apply that knowledge into engineering practice, especially in future careers. This is why in recent years we have strongly focused on experiential learning in all four years of the undergraduate experience. We developed courses for entering freshmen and capstones for graduating seniors, but we did not have anything for students in the heart of their university experience, particularly for those uncertain of their future aspirations. This was a driving force behind the formation of this course. The goal of the class was, and still is, to offer undergraduates experience with real-world data, teach them to work with a complete system, and provide them a contextual basis in which to apply their theoretical knowledge. This goal was established after careful consultation with our corporate affiliates and alumni. As a result, the course today has students build a fitness wearable from first principles. During the journey, they attain foundational Python software development skills and are exposed to many facets of ECE curriculum. In their final project, they repurpose their wearable to address a new, unrelated problem so as to be challenged to be critical thinkers working on open-ended problems - a highly sought-after skill by employers we surveyed. Due to the modular, often self-paced nature of the course, it has had a serendipitous outcome during the pandemic - namely, while being a highly hands-on course, it actually works extremely well in settings of remote instruction. Feedback from students has been surprisingly positive as they have had to work on their project kits from their homes rather than in the lab setting. Since much of their instruction in their other classes has shifted to lectures offered via video conferencing software, any opportunity to actually work with their hands has led to marked excitement and eagerness to participate in class, as has been directly observed by us. The focus of this paper will be to breakdown the course curriculum, demonstrate how it offers students a unique learning experience, and illustrate the effectiveness of the material even during remote instruction. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021},

abstract={The essence of prototyping is solving problems through the creation of physical or digital artifacts. In professional practice, engineers use these artifacts for many purposes: to communicate creative ideas, explore design alternatives, evolve the details of a solution, and achieve functional design solutions. The process of prototyping exists on a spectrum of scope (whole solution versus component of solution) and complexity (simple tools and materials versus manufacturing tools and materials). Years of study, practice, and repetition on machines and software packages are needed to acquire deep expertise in prototyping. Unfortunately, engineering students are expected to produce physical prototypes without the luxury of dedicated training in this skill, as much of their time is occupied by fundamentals and other course content. There exists a need to upskill engineering students to a point where they can gain momentum on physical and digital prototypes using trial-and-error processes. Prototyping schemas do exist but they are heavily abstract; other methods of instruction use principles to guide action in prototyping. Very few instructional materials exist that are step-by-step or heavily guided by the instructor. In academic makerspaces, prototyping education is completed through several avenues, including informal workshops, independent self-directed learning, and formal courses. This paper details over five years of results from a course that teaches skills in prototyping and fabrication seeking to increase student confidence towards producing high-resolution prototypes. This course includes modules that instruct students in many useful techniques for producing prototypes: how to build a box with hand tools (3 ways), post-processing and finishing objects, 2D drawing (digital), vector-based cutting, additive and subtractive 3D manufacturing methods, and the application of multiple toolchains/processes to produce objects. The course is designed to be high-touch and to simulate apprenticeship with an expert. All aspects of the course involve active learning and routine hands-on workshops. This structure enhances the student experience by making the environment practical instead of didactic. Grading is proficiency-based so students have standards of excellence to work towards. Students peer grade each other, which helps them to develop a critical eye for high-quality products as well as to articulate (and receive) feedback on their work. Students detail their progress in the class through a publicly viewable blog that showcases their process, decisions, failures, and triumphs. Through surveys and analyses of work products, we evaluated the learning outcomes of the course and found that a proficiency increase was measured in each of the techniques and tools that were instructed, furthermore, students recognized these proficiency increases. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021},

abstract={College-educated women in the workforce are discovering a latent interest in and aptitude for computing motivated by the prevalence of computing as an integral part of jobs in many fields as well as continued headlines about the number of unfilled, highly paid computing jobs. One of these women's choices for retraining are the so-called coding boot camps that teach programming skills through intensive multi-week courses. This article reports on a qualitative research study focused on the Silicon Valley area of California. We used social cognitive career theory (SCCT) to investigate the larger context surrounding women entering computing professions through boot camp learning sites, including: the environment of a booming technology workforce, boot camps as learning settings, the characteristics of women who attend boot camps, how retraining at a coding boot camp influence women's computing self-efficacy and outcome expectations, and the performance attainments of women at boot camps. Interview data was collected from 14 women who had attended boot camps-first before graduating from the boot camp and again after six months in the workforce. To contextualize the computing ecosystem, we conducted single interviews with 6 boot camp organizers/curriculum developers, 7 industry hiring managers, and 14 university computer science faculty. To provide a contrast with women at boot camps, we interviewed 5 women who majored in computer science at the university and with 17 men who had attended boot camps. Structural data coding and analysis was done focused on the SCCT mechanisms of environment, person inputs, learning experiences, self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and performance attainments. Findings here demonstrate that training at a boot camp can be the catalyst for college-educated women to attain computing jobs and careers, although these entry-level jobs may be a compromise to the goal of a software development job and are unlikely to lead to a job at large, well-known, established technology companies. © 2021 ACM.},

abstract={Understanding how novices reason about coding at a neurological level has implications for training the next generation of software engineers. In recent years, medical imaging has been increasingly employed to investigate patterns of neural activity associated with coding activity. However, such studies have focused on advanced undergraduates and professionals. In a human study of 31 participants, we use functional near-infrared spectroscopy to measure the neural activity associated with introductory programming. In a controlled, contrast-based experiment, we relate brain activity when coding to that of reading natural language or mentally rotating objects (a spatial visualization task). Our primary result is that all three tasks - coding, prose reading, and mental rotation - are mentally distinct for novices. However, while those tasks are neurally distinct, we find more significant differences between prose and coding than between mental rotation and coding. Intriguingly, we generally find more activation in areas of the brain associated with spatial ability and task difficulty for novice coding compared to that reported in studies with more expert developers. Finally, in an exploratory analysis, we also find a neural activation pattern predictive of programming performance 11 weeks later. While preliminary, these findings both expand on previous results (e.g., relating expertise to a similarity between coding and prose reading) and also provide a new understanding of the cognitive processes underlying novice programming. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={With a volatile labour and technological market, onboarding is becoming increasingly important. The process of incorporating a new developer, a.k.a. the newcomer, into a software development team is reckoned to be lengthy, frustrating and expensive. Newcomers face personal, interpersonal, process and technical barriers during their incorporation, which, in turn, affects the overall productivity of the whole team. This problem exacerbates for Software Product Lines (SPLs), where their size and variability combine to make onboarding even more challenging, even more so for developers that are transferred from the Application Engineering team into the Domain Engineering team, who will be our target newcomers. This work presents concept maps on the role of sensemaking scaffolds to help to introduce these newcomers into the SPL domain. Concept maps, used as knowledge visualisation tools, have been proven to be helpful for meaningful learning. Our main insight is to capture concepts of the SPL domain and their interrelationships in a concept map, and then, present them incrementally, helping newcomers grasp the SPL and aiding them in exploring it in a guided manner while avoiding information overload. This work's contributions are four-fold. First, concept maps are proposed as a representation to introduce newcomers into the SPL domain. Second, conceptmaps are presented as the means for a guided exploration of the SPL core assets. Third, a feature-driven concept map construction process is introduced. Last, the usefulness of concept maps as guides for SPL onboarding is tested through a formative evaluation. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the way that software development teams onboard new hires. Previously, most software developers worked in physical offices and new hires onboarded to their teams in the physical office, following a standard onboarding process. However, when companies transitioned employees to work from home due to the pandemic, there was little to no time to develop new onboarding procedures. In this paper, we present a survey of 267 new hires at Microsoft that onboarded to software development teams during the pandemic. We explored their remote onboarding process, including the challenges that the new hires encountered and their social connectedness with their teams. We found that most developers onboarded remotely and never had an opportunity to meet their teammates in person. This leads to one of the biggest challenges faced by these new hires, building a strong social connection with their team. We use these results to provide recommendations for onboarding remote hires. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={For several decades, graph and dataflow programming models have been niche topics limited to a small number of highly specialized domains. In recent years, however, the machine learning (ML) revolution and the proliferation of ML libraries has made graph programming accessible to even novice programmers. Before, a beginner programmer may have talked about writing a number-guessing game; today the programmer will describe training an off-The-shelf neural network-a type of graph-for handwriting recognition. There is growing demand from industry and individual users to run programs that are based on ML graphs. This demand is being met by hardware vendors, who are designing larger and increasingly heterogeneous accelerator devices that can efficiently execute graphs. Since its creation, OpenCL has been a key API for bridging the gap between user applications and accelerator hardware. The question, then, is whether OpenCL is an appropriate API for this new breed of graph software running on these large, heterogeneous accelerators. Does OpenCL have the expressive power required to describe an execution graph to accelerator hardware, or does OpenCL serialize graphs and execute them sequentially? This technical presentation argues that it is the former: OpenCL is sufficiently expressive to allow an ML library to describe an execution graph, and OpenCL is sufficiently powerful to execute that graph on a graph accelerator. The OpenCL API is designed around the concept of the user enqueuing commands onto the front of a command-queue. Commands include executing kernels (i.e., functions), and reading, writing, and copying data buffers. The OpenCL device driver removes commands from the back of a command-queue, sets up data transfers to and from the accelerator device, and schedules kernels to execute on the device. The command-queue abstraction can encode execution graphs in one of two ways, depending on whether the command-queue is an in-order command-queue or an out-of-order command-queue. An in-order command-queue guarantees that the effects of the enqueued commands will be as if the commands were executed in the order in which they were enqueued. However, the OpenCL device driver is allowed to reorder commands, provided that reordering does not affect the output. For example, if two kernels do not have a data dependency between them, then they can be executed in reverse order or even in parallel, if the driver and hardware support it. An out-of-order command-queue does not guarantee that commands will appear to have been executed in the order in which they were enqueued. Instead, it is the OpenCL API user's responsibility to attach events and event wait lists to commands. When a command finishes executing, it triggers its attached event, and when all the events in a command's event wait list have triggered, then that command is allowed to execute. Both types of command-queues are capable of describing execution graphs. For in-order command-queues, the graph is implied by kernels' data dependencies; for out-of-order command-queues, the graph is explicitly defined with events. By instrumenting Codeplay's ComputeAorta[2] OpenCL implementation, it is possible to record OpenCL API calls and to reconstruct the execution graph as seen by the OpenCL device driver. This presentation investigates the execution graphs generated by a simplified handwriting recognition neural network implemented in TensorFlow[1] and running on top of OpenCL via SYCL. Training a neural network and using a neural network for inference produce substantially different execution graphs. Both graphs are considered. The graphs show that data dependencies, opportunities for executing kernels in parallel, and opportunities for reordering kernels are all visible to the driver. It is therefore possible for an OpenCL device driver to schedule work to a hardware accelerator that has been designed for graph execution. It is important to note that OpenCL makes it possible to expose an execution graph to a device driver, but OpenCL cannot guarantee that OpenCL API calls will form a meaningful graph. For example, if a user places many independent data arrays into one memory buffer and enqueues kernels that all operate on the single memory buffer, then information about the execution graph is hidden from OpenCL. Opportunities for parallel execution and kernel reordering are lost. Often, application developers do not write OpenCL code directly, but use libraries that have OpenCL backends. Consequently, it is the responsibility of library developers to ensure that the graph that an application intends to execute is represented correctly on the OpenCL level. © 2021 ACM.},

abstract={Software designers and developers are increasingly relying on application frameworks as first-class design concepts. They instantiate the services that frameworks provide to implement various architectural tactics and patterns. One of the challenges in employing frameworks for such tasks is the difficulty of learning and correctly using the APIs of the frameworks. This paper introduces a learning-based approach called ARCODE to help novice programmers correctly use frameworks' APIs to implement architectural tactics and patterns. ARCODE has several novel components: a graph-based approach for learning specification of a framework from a limited number of training software, a program analysis algorithm to eliminate erroneous training data, and a recommender module to help programmers use APIs correctly and identify API misuses in their program. We evaluated our technique across two popular frameworks: JAAS security framework used for authentication and authorization tactic and Java RMI framework used to enable remote method invocation between client and server and other object oriented patterns. Our results demonstrate (i) the feasibility of using ARCODE to learn the specification of a framework; (ii) ARCODE generates accurate recommendations for finding the next API call to implement an architectural tactic/pattern based on the context of the programmer's code; (iii) it accurately detects API misuses in the code that implements a tactic/pattern and provides fix recommendations. We also demonstrate that ArCode outperforms two famous techniques, MAPO and GrouMiner, on API recommendation and misuse detection tasks. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={While open source software (OSS) development projects always seek contributions from newcomers to make the projects sustainable, newcomers often face with a challenge of onboarding. For developers with little experience, it is difficult to decide which of the many OSS projects to contribute to and which issues to tackle. To mitigate the barrier against onboarding, some OSS projects start using a label so called good first issue (GFI) which indicates the issue is easy to resolve and suitable for newcomers to tackle. The final goal of this study is to construct a model for recommending good first issues to help reduce maintainers' manual effort of selecting and labeling issues as GFIs and at the same time to help find GFIs suitable for each newcomer. Toward the final goal, we analyze GFIs in GitHub to deeply understand the current state of the GFI mechanism and its impact on new members' onboarding. This paper reports a result of our preliminary analysis of GFIs, based on 9, 475 GFIs collected from 11 famous OSS projects in GitHub. We find that (1) developers who have resolved GFIs have 92 fewer median PR (pull request) posts than developers who have resolved regular issues (i.e., developers tackling GFIs have less experience, compared to other developers), (2) on average, GFIs are resolved 32.5% more than regular issues (i.e., GFIs are easier to resolve. The dataset of GFIs might be able to be used as a training set for recommending GFIs to developers with less experience), and however (3) the percentage of developers who keep contributing to the same project even after resolving GFIs varies greatly from project to project (24.9% to 83.9%) (i.e, GFIs guide newcomers' onboarding only in particular projects). Based on the analysis result, we discuss the contents of GFIs which tend to keep newcomers on OSS projects. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={In the software industry, a variety of training courses have been adopted by companies for educating entry- level engineers to learn the basic knowledge of computer science and programming language(s). While such training courses are advocated as effective, little is known about the actual impact of the training courses. To fill this gap, we have conducted an empirical study to analyze the impact of a month-long training course in which 23 entry-level engineers of a company participated. In a nutshell, we found that source codes that are written by participants tend to be more functional and less redundant after the training course. © 2021 Japan Society for Software Science and Technology.

abstract={We conducted an ethnographic study of a software development company to explore if and how a development team adopts security practices into the development lifecycle. A PhD student in computer science with prior training in qualitative research methods was embedded in the company for eight months. The researcher joined the company as a software engineer and participated in all development activities as a new hire would, while also making observations on the development practices. During the fieldwork, we observed a positive shift in the development team's practices regarding secure development. Our analysis of data indicates that the shift can be attributed to enabling all software engineers to see how security knowledge could be applied to the specific software products they worked on. We also observed that by working with other developers to apply security knowledge under the concrete context where the software products were built, developers who possessed security expertise and wanted to push for more secure development practices (security advocates) could be effective in achieving this goal. Our data point to an interactive learning process where software engineers in a development team acquire knowledge, apply it in practice, and contribute to the team, leading to the creation of a set of preferred practices, or “culture” of the team. This learning process can be understood through the lens of the situated learning framework, where it is recognized that knowledge transfer happens within a community of practice, and applying the knowledge is the key in individuals (software engineers) acquiring it and the community (development team) embodying such knowledge in its practice. Our data show that enabling a situated learning environment for security gives rise to security-aware software engineers. We discuss the roles of management and security advocates in driving the learning process to start a security culture in a software company. © is held by the author/owner.

abstract={The science behind analyzing and building structures was laid out by legendary scientists such as Euler, Bernoulli, Gauss, Timoshenko and many others. The 20th century saw the birth of aviation and space travel, which required more advances in understanding structural behavior. The constraints on aerospace structures relative to weight, durability, performance, and damage tolerance are enormous, and in many instances, in competition with each other. Performance requirements driven by other disciplines: aerodynamics, thermal behavior, pressure containment, extreme stability, are now the norm in high performance aerospace structures. This paper explores the current trends in structures and makes the case for continued investments in structures: The authors highlight the current trends as: • Failure to make continued research and development in the Structures discipline a high priority. Investment into advancing basic understanding of structural mechanics phenomena and behavior (design/analysis/test) has waned in recent years. • An assumption by those outside the discipline that structures is a relatively mature, well understood technology and techniques currently in use are able to predict performance reasonably well. • Lack of mentoring of younger engineers in recent years, due to loss of older experienced mentors, and oversubscription of experienced personnel on critical development programs. Expert analysts and designers understand how advanced structures behave and how to adequately design them, but many junior engineers may not possess this knowledge. • The advancements in computing engines and software are allowing users who have little or no background in engineering mechanics to perform analyses and post-process the results of these analyses. As such, the trend of blind acceptance of analyses and lack of critical, physics-based, assessment of results, are two significant problems of today. More training and mentoring of junior engineers is needed to assure that lessons and knowledge from past experience is not lost. © 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

abstract={The combination of scale and distribution in software projects makes the onboarding of new developers problematic. To the best of our knowledge, there is no research on the relationship between onboarding strategies and the performance evolution of newcomers in large-scale, globally distributed projects. Furthermore, there are no approaches to support the development of strategies to systematically onboard developers. In this paper, we address these gaps by means of an industrial case study. We identified that the following aspects seem to be related to the observed onboarding results: the distance to mentors, the formal training approach used, the allocation of large and distributed tasks in the early stages of the onboarding process, and team instability. We conclude that onboarding must be planned well ahead and should consider avoiding the aspects mentioned above. Based on the results of this investigation, we propose a process to strategize and evaluate onboarding. To develop the process, we used business process modeling. We conducted a static validation of the proposed process utilizing interviews with experts. The static validation of the process indicates that it can help companies to deal with the challenges associated with the onboarding of newcomers through more systematic, effective, and repeatable onboarding strategies. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Both distributed and collocated software teams use collaborative communication channels, such as instant messaging (IM) tools, to support software development and management tasks. Furthermore, when teams use IM tools, relevant software-related discussions end up stored in these tools' log files. This research aims to investigate how we can extract and use projects' knowledge from developers' IM logs to support newcomers' onboarding. We propose an approach based on data-mining techniques to automatically obtain frequent software-related discussions from the developer's IM logs, extracting what we call the Project's Frequent Knowledge (PFK). We assessed the proposed approach evaluating three newcomers' knowledge acquisition regarding a software project. The results demonstrated that, on average, 70% of the frequent software-related discussions identified in this study were useful to determine the PFK, and newcomers were able to comprehend software related issues by analyzing the PFK. Our findings indicate the usefulness of the proposed approach to extract software knowledge from developers' IM logs and support newcomers' onboarding. Moreover, a conducted follow-up interview involving newcomers and the team's project manager revealed the feasibility of using PFK on knowledge transfer and acquisition. © 2020 ACM.},

abstract={Access to haptic technology is on the rise, in smartphones, virtual reality gear, and open-source education kits. However, engineers and interaction designers are often inexperienced in designing with haptics, and rarely have tools and guidelines for creating multisensory experiences. To examine the impact of this deficit, we supplied a haptic design kit, custom software, and technical support to nine teams (25 students) for an innovation challenge at a major haptics conference. Teams (predominantly undergraduate engineers with little haptics, interaction design, or education training) designed and built haptic environments to support learning of science topics. Qualitative analysis of surveys, interviews, team blogs, and expert assessments of teams' final demonstrations exposed three themes in these design efforts. 1) Novice teams tended to ignore many of ten design choices that experts navigate, such as explicitly choosing whether haptic and graphic feedback should reinforce versus complement one other. 2) Their design activities differed in timing and inclusion from the ten activities observed in expert process. 3) We identified three success strategies in how teams devised useful and engaging interactions and interpretable multimodal experiences, and communicated about their designs. We compare novice and expert design needs and highlight where future haptic design tools and theory need to support novice practice and training. © 2008-2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Software developers who want to start contributing to an Open Source Software (OSS) project often struggle to find appropriate first tasks. The voluntary, self-organizing distribution of decentralized labor and the distinct nature of some OSS projects intensifies this challenge. Mentors, who work closely with newcomers, develop strategies to recommend tasks. However, to date neither the challenges mentors face in recommending tasks nor their strategies have been formally documented or studied. In this paper, we interviewed mentors of well-established OSS projects (n=10) and qualitatively analyzed their answers to identify both challenges and strategies related to recommending tasks for newcomers. Then, we employed a survey (n=30) to map the strategies to challenges and collect additional strategies. Our study identified 7 challenges and 13 strategies related to task recommendation. Strategies such as "tagging the issues based on difficulty,""adding documentation,""assigning a small task first and then challenge the newcomers with bigger tasks,"and "dividing tasks into smaller pieces"were frequently mentioned as ways to overcome multiple challenges. Our results provide insights for mentors about the strategies OSS communities can use to guide their mentors and for tool builders who design automated support for task assignment. © 2020 ACM.},

abstract={Global Software Development has brought many benefits to the industry. On the other hand, it carries with it new challenges mostly regarding knowledge transfer. When new hires join a company, they should learn about the working process, organization structure and company corporate culture. Therefore, companies should be adopting strategies to manage and transfer knowledge to better support newcomers as well as to hire new members to increase the developer team due to massive demand. As we work in GSD scope, we use Wiki as an alternative for sharing knowledge and for helping newcomers learn about our software development process. However, newer members reported great difficulty during Wiki usage, due to a large amount of information, lack of information process and non-structural knowledge sharing. For this reason, we surveyed to understand which difficulties newer PLs members faced during wiki usage at Sidia R&D Institute. The results show important contributions to understand how their learning work process, difficulties to access wiki information caused by usability issues and knowledge management adequate. Despite it, one important finding is that Wiki did informal aid learning, but there is still plenty of room for improvement. © 2020 ACM.},

abstract={Software development teams dedicate considerable resources to training newcomers. Newcomers are new developers to a software project. The software onboarding process is more complicated than onboarding into other organizations. It is much more challenging and time-consuming. The role of a mentor in onboarding newcomers in software engineering is well understood. However, the disruptions to the work of an experienced developer can reduce the quality of their work and job satisfaction. We propose a conversational bot that can help onboard newcomers to a software project instead of an experienced programmer. The bot will act as a mentor for the newcomer, thus putting less stress on experienced programmers. The bot will also be able to scan outside sources, such as stack overflow, for solutions to issues a newcomer may face. The newcomer will be able to interact with the bot using natural language. We will use this bot to assess improvements to code quality in future studies. © 2020 ACM.},

abstract={Employers need engineers capable of leveraging CFD simulations to make intelligent design decisions, but undergraduate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) courses are not adequately preparing students for this type of work. CFD courses commonly familiarize students with topics, such as method derivation, domain creation, boundary conditions, mesh convergence, turbulence models, numerical convergence, and error analysis. This approach is an effective way to teach novices how CFD software works and how to prepare CFD analyses. However, it neglects development of higher level CFD skills and intuition important to engineering analysis and design, deferring this task to future study and training. This paper introduces the “Machine Learning Driven Interpretation of Fluid Dynamics Simulations to Develop Student Intuition” (MIFoS) software, a program designed to help CFD novices develop the high-level skills and intuition that employers need in their engineers. A data-driven approach was used to create the MIFoS software, which allows the submission of arbitrary geometries, automates an external flow simulation, and returns expert-level graphical interpretation of simulation data. MIFoS's automated CFD simulation and feedback space allows novices to experiment with expert-level suggestions on their own designs, enabling the skill and intuition development typically gained through years of study, practice, and expert guidance. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency (GISTDA) has initiated a program named the Innovation Internship program, for university students who are interested in space technology, especially telecommunication engineering. The program is also called Ignite star. The aim of the project is for young university students to gain more experience on CubeSat satellites expectedly on VHF/UHF Transceivers. The Student Small Satellite project has been established by APSCO since 2016. There are 3 constellation satellites, which consist of one micro-satellite with the name of SSS-1 at 30 kg and two CubeSats. The two CubeSats have been given the names of SSS-2A and SSS-2B, which are both 3U CubeSats at about 4 kg each. The SSS-2B is led by Turkey and the Thailand team supports the development. These satellites are designed and manufactured by guidance from the space agency and cooperation of the APSCO members. The objective of this program is to promote cooperation, joint development and share the achievements among the members in space technology via hands on satellite development. In this paper presents the Ignite star program, which is an internship student program. The procedure to select the students is described. There are 4 students will have this opportunity to join this training short course. Furthermore, only 2 students, who get the highest score at the end of the ignite star program will participate the SSS-2B satellite testing and training at Turkey about the end of 2019. The program started at the beginning of June and finished at the end of July. The students have been assigned to design their own project in the satellite communication field. There are 4th oral presentations in front of the external examiners, who are the specialist from difference universities. Therefore, GISTDA engineers involve along the project as personal instructors for each student. Moreover, these students are preparing to understand and gain knowledge in satellite communication, SSS-2B specification and satellite testing procedure. GISTDA perceives this as an opportunity for Thailand to gain experience in space technology for students and co-operation with APSCO members. This project will be the great step moving forward to build up the space technology capacity for Thailand. © 2020 40th Asian Conference on Remote Sensing, ACRS 2019: "Progress of Remote Sensing Technology for Smart Future".

abstract={Constructive-synthesizing modeling and the Process Mining methods in a toolkit to monitor and analyze the software debugging process were applied. Methods for monitoring the development and debugging processes are the basis for improving the level of practical training of students, reducing the time that is used irrationally in the process of software development by a student, and in monitoring the processes of performance of tasks by a teacher. The process of software debugging is seen as a sequence of actions when dealing with relevant tools. Using the methodology of constructive-synthesizing modeling, a constructor for forming a debugging actions log was developed. Based on the constructive model, the extension to the integrated development environment (IDE) Microsoft Visual Studio, in which all debugging actions are recorded in an event log, was designed. During debugging in the IDE, event logs are collected and then a conformance checking of these logs with regard to the reference model is performed. To do this, the ProM (Eindhoven Technical University, Netherlands), a platform for Process Mining methods, is used. By checking compliance, it is possible to compare different debugging processes and recognize behavioral similarities and differences. The main purpose of the developed toolkit is to collect debugging actions from the developer's IDE. By better understanding how students grasp and deal with errors, one can help novices learn to program. Knowing how programmers debug can encourage researchers to develop more practically directed methods, enable teachers to improve their debugging curricula and allow tool developers to adapt the debugger to the actual needs of users. It is practically suggested to use the prepared tools in the software engineering course © 2020. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={With the growing interest of adopting agile methods in offshored process, many companies realized that the use of agile methods and practices in companies located outside the location of early adopters of agile methods may be challenging. India, the main destination of offshoring contracts, have received particular attention, due to the big cultural differences. Critical analysis of related studies suggests that impeding behaviors are mostly rooted in the hierarchical culture of Indian organizations and related management behavior of command-and-control. But what happens in distributed projects with a more empowering onshore management? In this paper, we present the findings from a multiple-case study of DevOps teams with members from a mature agile company located in Sweden and a more hierarchical offshore vendor from India. Based on two focus groups we list culturally different behaviors of offshore engineers that were reported to impede agile ways of working. Furthermore, we report the findings from surveying 36 offshore team members from five DevOps teams regarding their likely behavior in situations reported to be problematic. Our findings confirm a number of previously reported behaviors rooted in cultural differences that impede the adoption of agile ways of working when collaborating with offshore engineers. At the same time, our survey results suggest that among the five surveyed teams there were teams that succeeded with the cultural integration of the offshore team members. Finally, our findings demonstrate the importance of cultural training especially when onboarding new team members. © The Author(s) 2020.},

abstract={The IT sector struggles with talent acquisition and low retention rates. While several field studies have explored onboarding of software developers, the software engineering literature lacks studies that develop and evaluate theoretical models. This study seeks to explore the link between onboarding of new hires and turnover intention of these professionals. In particular, we develop a theoretical model that identifies a number of onboarding activities, and link these to onboarding success. We then look at what we have termed “organizational fit,” which we define as two aspects of software professionals, namely job satisfaction and the quality of their relationships on the workfloor, and investigate how these mediate the relation between short-term onboarding success and a longer-term intention to leave (or stay with) an organization. We test our model with a sample of 102 software professionals using PLS-SEM. The findings suggest that providing support to new hires plays a major role in onboarding success, but that training is less important. Further, we found that job satisfaction mediates the relationship between onboarding success and turnover intention, but workplace relationship quality does not. Based on the findings, we discuss a number of implications for practice and suggestions for future research. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Many software developers struggle to understand code written by others, leading to increased maintenance costs. Research on program comprehension to date has primarily focused on individual developers attempting to understand code. However, software developers also work together to share and transfer understanding of their codebases. This is common during the onboarding process, when a new developer has joined a project or a company. The work reported here uses a Grounded Theory approach to explore the different types of information passed from experts to newcomers during onboarding, and the perceived value of these types. The theory is grounded in field-study data collected during twelve in-situ onboarding sessions, across eight organizations, with a design based on two pilot studies that were carried out in advance. The field-study data was supplemented and validated with interviews and questionnaires. It provides a description of four views through which the experts represent their code to the newcomers, revealing several interesting aspects of expert-led program comprehension. In particular, it provides evidence that extends current thinking on the temporal aspect of code: where experts discuss changes that have been made to the code-base, changes that are currently being made to the code-base (including temporary fixes) and changes intended for the code-base in the future. In addition, a rationale-based view of the code-base is emphasized in the findings, making explicit the system’s functional/non-functional requirements, and their impact on the system’s design. This information was perceived as highly valued by the newcomers. Additionally, Structural and Algorithmic views, which have already been firmly established in program comprehension literature, were also noted in these onboarding sessions. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Engaging contributors in a Free Open Source Software (FOSS) project can be challenging. Finding an appropriate task to start with is a common entrance barrier for newcomers. Poor code quality contributes to difficulties in the onboarding process and limits contributor satisfaction in general. In turn, dissatisfied developers tend to exacerbate problems with system integrity. Poorly designed systems are difficult to maintain and extend. Users can often directly experience these issues as instabilities in system behavior. Thus code quality is a key issue for users and contributors in FOSS. We present a case study on the interactions between code quality and contributor experience in the real-world FOSS project Catrobat. We describe the implications of a refactoring process in terms of code metrics and benefits for developers and users.

abstract={FAQ chatbots possess the capability to provide answers to frequently asked questions of a particular service, platform, or system. Currently, FAQ chatbot is the most popular domain of use of dialog assistants. However, developing a chatbot project requires a full-stack team formed by numerous specialists, such as dialog designer, data scientist, software engineer, DevOps, business strategist and experts from the domain, which can be both time and resources consuming. Language processing can be particularly challenging in languages other than English due to the scarcity of training datasets. Most of the requirements of FAQ chatbots are similar, domain-specific, and projects could profit from Open Source Software (OSS) reuse. In this paper, we examine how OSS FAQ chatbot projects can benefit from reuse at the project level (black-box reuse). We present an experience report of a FLOSS FAQ chatbot project developed in Portuguese to an e-government service in Brazil. It comprises of the chatbot distribution service, as well as for analytics tool integrated and deployed on-premises. We identified assets that could be reused as a black-box and the assets that should be customized for a particular application. We categorized these assets in architecture, corpus, dialog flows, machine learning models, and documentation. This paper discusses how automation, pre-configuration, and templates can aid newcomers to develop chatbots in Portuguese without the need for specialized skills required from tools in chatbot. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={The professional practice of Civil Engineering relies on both the understanding of fundamental engineering concepts and the ability to use software for efficiently designing buildings, bridges, roads, sites and infrastructure pipe networks. The Civil Engineering Department at the University of Hartford has embraced the challenge of updating many of our courses to include the use of Civil3D into all four years of the students' curriculum to enhance learning and to improve students' success in landing a career. Based on advice from the Department's Advisory Board, Civil3D was selected as the software platform that is used throughout the civil engineering industry. This initiative supports the overriding theme of the Third Edition of the Civil Engineering Body of Knowledge that is “focused on preparing the future civil engineer for entry into the practice of civil engineering at the professional level [1].” Specifically, the use of design software enhances the Engineering Fundamental Outcome of Critical Thinking & Problem Solving and the Technical Outcome of Design. The assignments used in junior and senior level courses focus both on the technical (e.g. size and slope of pipe) and constructability/maintainability (e.g. proximity to other utilities and access for maintenance) aspects of design that engineers face in practice. The Department leveraged a faculty development grant to pay professors to learn the software and to build it into the curriculum for their classes. The Department also partnered with Eagle Point Software to make their on-line training platform available to every civil engineering student and faculty member to provide on-demand assistance with Civil3D and AutoCad commands and work flows. In its second year of implementation, we have observed significant improvement of Computer-Aided Design and Drafting (CADD), problem solving, and design skills in our senior class. Our Advisory Board members and alumni have advised us of the importance of frequent use of computer design skills to achieve fluency in applying the skills for the practice of engineering at the professional level. Assessment of the project is achieved through review of project assignments and project deliverables with working professionals who have and will continue to provide feedback relating to the skills our students are demonstrating and through the direct polling of current students. We also intend to begin polling employers of recent graduates about the level of preparedness for the job. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019.},

abstract={The success of a software company is largely dependent upon the people who comprise the company. Given the pace at which most software needs to be produced, software companies need to make sure that new developers become as productive as quickly as possible when hired. The process of integrating new hires, often referred as onboarding, has been well studied in the context of large companies that have significant resources to bring to bear on the process. How onboarding occurs in smaller companies with fewer resources is less understood. To investigate how smaller companies address onboarding, we performed a case study, interviewing eight developers from a local company with a development team of about 100. We asked the developers what practices they experienced during their onboarding with the company. We found a high reliance on a buddy system and extensive use of code reviews to instruct developers in best practices. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Large-scale distributed software projects with long life cycles often involve a considerable amount of complex legacy code. The combination of scale and distribution challenges and the difficulty in acquiring knowledge about massive amounts of complex legacy code may make the onboarding of new developers/teams problematic. These problems may lead to extended periods of low performance. The primary objective of this paper is to investigate the performance evolution of offshore newcomers onboarded in a large-scale globally distributed project and how it relates to the employed onboarding strategy. To achieve our objective, we conducted a case study in Ericsson. We identified that the following aspects in the onboarding strategy employed in the investigated case seem to be related to the unexpectedly low performance evolution: i) the distance to mentors; ii) the used formal training approach, which did not fit the sociocultural background of the newcomers; iii) allocation of large and distributed tasks in the early stages of the onboarding process; and iv) team instability. We conclude that the onboarding of newcomers in globally distributed projects must be planned well ahead and should consider avoiding the aspects mentioned above. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The names of software artifacts, e.g., method names, are important for software understanding and maintenance, as good names can help developers easily understand others' code. However, the existing naming guidelines are difficult for developers, especially novices, to come up with meaningful, concise and compact names for the variables, methods, classes and files. With the popularity of open source, an enormous amount of project source code can be accessed, and the exhaustiveness and instability of manually naming methods could now be relieved by automatically learning a naming model from a large code repository. Nevertheless, building a comprehensive naming system is still challenging, due to the gap between natural language functional descriptions and method names. Specifically, there are three challenges: how to model the relationship between the functional descriptions and formal method names, how to handle the explosion of vocabulary when dealing with large repositories, and how to leverage the knowledge learned from large repositories to a specific project. To answer these questions, we propose a neural network to directly generate readable method names from natural language description. The proposed method is built upon the encoder-decoder framework with the attention and copying mechanisms. Our experiments show that our method can generate meaningful and accurate method names and achieve significant improvement over the state-of-The-Art baseline models. We also address the cold-start problem using a training trick to utilize big data in Github for specific projects. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={In machine learning, neural networks have excelled at performing tasks at a high level with a simple and flexible implementation. Neural networks are particularly well-suited for novice programmers due to the availability of open-source libraries like TensorFlow and Caffe. However, novice programmers often neglect to learn beyond the black-box behaviors that these libraries provide. Introductory college students often lack the understanding of neural network internals, such as hidden layers and activation functions, and their interactions during training, which are crucial to efficiently solving more complex problems. Here, we present Omega3, a device that opens up the black-box of neural networks by visually representing how hidden layers behave during training in real-time. In addition, Omega3 provides an engaging tactile and visual educational experience to students, and waives the requirement for a strong programming background in order to learn about neural networks. In this paper, we will discuss the fabrication and set-up of Omega3 as well as evaluate and compare Omega3 to traditional lecture-based learning. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Human and AI collaboration has evolved drastically over the past decade. Most of the tasks are now partly handled by machines and partly by humans, resulting in human and AI partnership. Humans share their tasks with the AI agents as they are good at performing predictive and repetitive tasks. The tasks assigned to the agents can be dynamic in nature and can change over time. This may lead to acquiring new skills or re-training to improvise on the same task. The developer needs to programme these agents every time for a new domain. In this work, we propose a framework that helps in developing apprentice agents that learn from Human demonstration. Apprenticeship learning is the process of learning by observing an expert performing actions to achieve a specific goal. The agent observes the expert’s actions, the sensory inputs and then trains itself using the observed data. We also propose a process to learn and self-diagnose the agent’s action for apprenticeship learning. The framework alleviates the need to explicitly program the apprentice agents.

Therefore, a qualified applicant needs to have an engineering degree and "discover" the flight test field somewhere in his or her career. That may happen randomly by being placed in a flight test organization and gaining the experience on the job. Other engineers plot a career path that takes them through a formal test pilot school (military or civilian). Either way, the typical flight test engineer tends to be a mid-level career position. There really aren't "entry-level" flight test engineer positions. The author believes this is a missed opportunity. Why not introduce the flight test career field at the undergraduate level in universities? Why not offer specialized flight test engineering courses that lead to a Graduate Certificate or Master's Degree at a standard university? Is there a need for entry-level engineers with knowledge of the basic flight test disciplines (performance, stability & control, systems) along with 15-20 flights collecting data? The answer is yes. Not every flight test engineer needs to be a graduate of a high-cost formal test pilot school with 60 or more flight hours. Younger, more junior engineers can make great contributions with basic knowledge and less flights. In addition, more engineers have access to universities and can afford the education compared to formal test pilot schools. Florida Tech has been running a flight test engineering program since 2015 that awards Graduate Certificates in Flight Test Engineering for less than $20,000 and full Master's Degrees for less than $50,000. It produces graduates with basic flight test knowledge along with the experience of 15-20 flights collecting and analyzing data. Other universities can easily replicate the program at Florida Tech. Now that these graduates exist, more companies and flight test organizations need to expand their position descriptions to include an "entry-level" position. This paper will provide the details of the Florida Tech program for others to replicate. © 2019 by Society of Flight Test Engineers (SFTE). All rights reserved.},

abstract={This work has been presented at the 34th International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME) in Madrid, Spain [?]6. Successful open source communities are constantly looking for new members and helping them become active developers. A common approach for developer onboarding in open source projects is to let newcomers focus on relevant yet easy-to-solve issues to familiarize themselves with the code and the community. The goal of this research is twofold. First, we aim at automatically identifying issues that newcomers can resolve by analyzing the history of resolved issues by simply using the title and description of issues. Second, we aim at automatically identifying issues, that can be resolved by newcomers who later become active developers. We mined the issue trackers of three large open source projects and extracted natural language features from the title and description of resolved issues. In a series of experiments, we optimized and compared the accuracy of four supervised classifiers to address our research goals. Random Forest, achieved up to 91% precision (Fl-score 72%) towards the first goal while for the second goal, Decision Tree achieved a precision of 92% (Fl-score 91%). A qualitative evaluation gave insights on what information in the issue description is helpful for newcomers. Our approach can be used to automatically identify, label, and recommend issues for newcomers in open source software projects based only on the text of the issues. © 2019 Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI).

abstract={Many people think “adaptive instruction” is synonymous with “personalized instruction” or training that is designed to appeal to the desires and whims of the individual learner. However, since the purpose of training is to support an organization’s needs for a fully competent and developed workforce, adaptive instruction is better thought of as training that is designed to change the training based on the learning needs of the individual (or group) as identified by gaps in the learner’s knowledge as well as the learner’s depth of understanding with the content. After all, the purpose of training is to “impact … individual, process, work team, and/or organizational performance” [1]. The adaptations are all about providing each learner with the training they need based upon precise gaps in the individual’s knowledge and skill level (e.g., novice or expert) with the content, all while ensuring the training is designed in line with learning theories about how people learn. For example, if the gap is for a specific motor skill, then the training will provide opportunities for the learner to practice, develop, and hone the skill. This could be done in virtual, simulated, or live environments. The reason for having physical practice is not because the learner “prefers motion” or is a so-called “kinesthetic learner,” but because the desired training outcome is physical performance of the task. Those who are unfamiliar with the instructional design approaches to adaptive instruction might view the notion of “testing out” of a course as a form of adaptive training (or at the very least a precursor to the current approach). However, the test-out method is built around a linear view of training, as well as a view that all learners must work through all of the training materials. The problem is that people have very different backgrounds and knowledge bases and clearly do not all require the same training to be able to succeed in their work [2]. In addition, sometimes the training gaps demonstrate that some of the training which has been traditionally taught in a linear fashion does not need to be delivered in this way. This is not to suggest that there are not logical sequences or progressions of development. Rather, instructional design should expand its view of what is possible in training delivery and design the course to best meet the needs of the learners and workforce. Consider that 20 years ago we had to design courses to fit into specific time blocks because we had to account for the limitations of having an instructor and trainees gathered together. This led to the development of some courses that follow a highly structured progression even though the concepts and skills are not logically linear at all. The use of adaptive instruction can allow for a very different method of delivery. Instructional designers use learning theories and best practices in instructional design to determine which teaching strategies to use for specific types of learning. Thus, it falls to the instructional designer to determine how the training ought to be developed to best meet the needs of the individual learner. The adaptive instructional system (AIS) must have methods to identify the learner’s knowledge and skill level and must deliver training which supports each unique combination of knowledge and skill level, especially as learners gain knowledge and their skill levels change. The author investigates research-based approaches to identifying the knowledge gaps and skills in academic settings and applies these to workplace training. Further, the author identifies specific instructional design approaches and organizational thinking which are needed to support this type of adaptive approach to workplace training. The paper identifies the necessary technical components and capabilities for a fully functional AIS which provides adaptive training based on the learner’s gaps in knowledge and different skill level (from novice to expert). The discussion provides specific examples to illustrate how the adaptive training would differ for the individual learners in training designed for pilots, air traffic controllers, project managers, etc. Finally, the author calls upon instructional designers and software engineers to collaborate in developing systems which will provide the type of training the workforce needs and help us learn more about how people learn so that we can refine the training even as we learn about what works best. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={There is little information on how best to educate students on quantum computing. There will very soon be an urgent need for pedagogically sound quantum computing instruction. Hundreds of millions of dollars are being invested in quantum computers. To innovate, develop, operate and maintain these, quantum computers takes a workforce that understands what is happening and what the objectives are. In an effort to achieve new capabilities with quantum computing, intense efforts are underway where additional subject matter experts are added to the team to solve a challenge. For example, microwave engineers are added to the quantum computing team, or software engineers, or computer programmers, electrical engineers, computer engineers, and heating and cooling engineers. Where are they getting their quick and intense training to introduce them to the team? On site, presumably. Who is training and teaching them? The hard pressed researchers, never trained in the best way to teach, themselves, now taken away from their priority time to familiarize the newcomers? We are two PhD Computer Science candidates, experiencing the learning of quantum computing for the first time, and we wish to share our experiences and best discoveries to help others shorten their time to understanding. It is our belief that the best educational level to target is at the honors level high school (junior or senior), as this would insure universal understanding by all likely professionals needing to learn quantum computing in an intense foundation course. It also could be used to teach high school students, as their generation will benefit from the capabilities of quantum computing. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

abstract={The unemployment rate in South Africa for first quarter 2017 was just under thirty percent. To help alleviate this problem, the South African Revenue Service offers certain tax incentives to companies which operate internships or in-service training to under-skilled individuals. At the same time of this high unemployment rate, there is a shortage of certain IT skills in the country including a shortage of Java programmers. This paper describes research in offering internships to people who hold some sort of documented proof of computer literacy such as the ICDL and training them to write test automation programs in Java. The internship creates a pathway from test automation to entry level Java programmer. This paper describes two iterations of the process and documents the training offered to the interns, the successes and the lessons learned. In the second iteration (and the final iteration described in this paper), interns learned Java programming by writing test program in Java using Sikulix (to test Java application), Selenium (to test websites) and Robotium (to test Android apps).

In this study, we investigate whether and how contributions from developers with low experience in a project do receive a different treatment during code review. We compare reviewers' experience, metrics of reviewers' attention, and change merge rate between changes from newcomers and from more experienced authors in 60 active open source projects.

abstract={It has been 50 years since the term "software engineering" was coined in 1968 at a NATO conference. The field should be relatively mature by now, with most established universities covering core software engineering topics in their Computer Science programs and others offering specialized degrees. However, still many practitioners lament a lack of skills in new software engineering hires. With the growing demand for software engineers from the industry, this apparent gap becomes more and more pronounced. One corporate strategy to address this gap is for the industry to develop supplementary training programs before the hiring process, which could also help companies screen viable candidates. In this paper, we report on our experiences and lessons learned in conducting a summer school program aimed at screening new graduates, introducing them to core skills relevant to the organization and industry, and assessing their attitudes toward mastering those skills before the hiring process begins. Our experience suggests that such initiatives can be mutually beneficial for new hires and companies alike. We support this insight with pre- A nd post-training data collected from the participants during the first edition of the summer school and a follow-up questionnaire conducted after a year with the participants, 50% of whom were hired by the company shortly after the summer school. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

Therefore, training experienced software practitioners is a challenging task. To address this gap, we propose an interactive virtual reality training environment for software practitioners to gain virtual experience based on the tasks of software development. The goal is to transport participants to a virtual software development organization where they experience simulated development process problems and conflicting situations, where they will interact virtually with distinctive personalities, roles and characters borrowed from real software development organizations. This PhD in progress paper investigates the literature and proposes a novel approach where participants can acquire important new process knowledge.

abstract={Onboarding is the process of supporting new employees regarding their social and performance adjustment to their new job. Software companies have faced challenges with recruitment and onboarding of new team members, and there is no study that investigates it in a holistic way. In this paper, we conducted a multi-case study to investigate the onboarding of software developers/teams, associated challenges, and areas for further improvement in 3 globally distributed legacy projects. We employed Bauer's model for onboarding to identify the current state of the onboarding strategies employed in each case. We learned that the employed strategies are semi-formalized. Besides, in projects with multiple sites, some functions are executed locally, and the onboarding outcomes may be hard to control. We also learned that onboarding in legacy projects is especially challenging and that decisions to distribute such projects across multiple locations shall be approached carefully. In our cases, the challenges to learn legacy code were further amplified by the project scale and the distance to the original sources of knowledge. Finally, we identified practices that can be used by companies to increase the chances of being successful when onboarding software developers and teams in globally distributed legacy projects.

abstract={The impact ofmicrobial communities, also known as themicrobiome, on human health and the environment is receiving increased attention. Studying translated gene products (proteins) and comparing metaproteomic profiles may elucidate how microbiomes respond to specific environmental stimuli, and interact with host organisms. Characterizing proteins expressed by a complex microbiome and interpreting their functional signature requires sophisticated informatics tools and workflows tailored to metaproteomics. Additionally, there is a need to disseminate these informatics resources to researchers undertaking metaproteomic studies, who could use them to make new and important discoveries in microbiome research. The Galaxy for proteomics platform (Galaxy-P) offers an open source, web-based bioinformatics platform for disseminating metaproteomics software and workflows. Within this platform, we have developed easily-accessible and documented metaproteomic software tools and workflows aimed at training researchers in their operation and disseminating the tools for more widespread use. The modular workflows encompass the core requirements of metaproteomic informatics: (a) database generation; (b) peptide spectral matching; (c) taxonomic analysis and (d) functional analysis. Much of the software available via the Galaxy-P platform was selected, packaged and deployed through an online metaproteomics "Contribution Fest" undertaken by a unique consortium of expert software developers and users from the metaproteomics research community, who have co-authored this manuscript. These resources are documented on GitHub and freely available through the Galaxy Toolshed, as well as a publicly accessible metaproteomics gateway Galaxy instance. These documented workflows are well suited for the training of novice metaproteomics researchers, through online resources such as the Galaxy Training Network, as well as hands-on training workshops. Here, we describe the metaproteomics tools available within these Galaxy-based resources, as well as the process by which they were selected and implemented in our community-based work.

abstract={Subject area: Agile software development, Knowledge workers and Lean thinking as a management system Study level/applicability: The case lends itself to students of business management, or aspiring consultants, who have been exposed to operations management in general and Lean thinking specifically. It is an advanced case study, assuming prior knowledge in these subjects and approaches the subject matter from an organisational development point of view, rather than a pure operations point of view. It is thus well suited to an elective on operational excellence on an MBA or in executive education courses in Lean thinking Case overview: The case starts with Mark, manager of a software development team, hearing that he will have budget for two new developers who will join his team in the coming year. While the extra help could be useful, he was considering what the impact of new people would be on the productivity of the team, which he felt was already stretched. Mark continues to consider the entire development chain and how code changes were implemented to ACSESim’s (the company’s primary product) graphical user interfaces. Having recently been acquired by an American company, he was also under pressure to start to adopt some of the parent company’s systems, which would constitute a fairly disruptive, but necessary, change, particularly for future collaborations with other developers in the parent company. With two new developers, experience taught Mark that development could slow down owing to training efforts. To minimise disruption, he was wondering about how to get the new developers up-to-speed quickly and streamline their operations within a changing corporate environment. The case highlights the different mechanisms that were in place at ACSESim, including the use of issue trackers; Kanban boards; version control software; automated systems; stand-up meetings, etc. Each of these mechanisms is discussed briefly and shows the value they added to the development practices that were in place. This also allows students to understand Agile practices and what Lean thinking might mean in a knowledge work environment and then to consider what the proposed changes might mean and how they could be deployed. Expected learning outcomes: To gain an understanding of how Lean and Agile principles can be applied in a software development environment and Lean knowledge work in general To consider the best way to manage new hires so that they can become productive in a Lean or Agile software development environment, whilst dealing with pressures to migrate to new systems.

abstract={Smartphones have become such an indispensable part of the modern day individual’s life that it has become almost impossible to escape their use on a daily basis. The less obtrusive, yet more invasive role that these devices play in various aspects of everyday life is further amplified by the introduction of wearable devices that act as complementary extensions of functionality and sensing. Despite the various advantages that smartphones may offer, it is important to note that technology is still subordinate to the motives and morality of those who choose to make use of it (Casey, 2011:286). As such, cyber criminals may now write and distribute smartphone applications (apps) that are able to harness the full capabilities of these smart devices and access the information stored on them – possibly without a user’s knowledge or consent. With purely technical countermeasures having been found to possibly overwhelm and intimidate end users of a non-technical nature (Felt et al., 2012), these approaches are often rendered useless, leaving the end user equally exposed to smartphone threats that may be exploited by cyber criminals. In this paper, we aim to address this problem by determining the specific level of device usage competency of an individual smartphone user, thereby making it possible to provide them with level-appropriate training and awareness content that does not intimidate or overwhelm them. To assist in this endeavour, we make use of the Smartphone Application User Security Competency Evolution (SAUSCE) model to evaluate the levels of device specialisation of two separate groups of university students enrolled for software engineering degrees in Johannesburg, South Africa – those in their first year of study, and those in their fourth year of study. The main findings from the study pointed out that the vast majority of both junior and senior students possess a smartphone which is indicative of the proliferating nature of these devices, while the most popular operating system choice for senior students is Android. Moreover, the majority of senior students were found to be developer active users that write and deploy their own apps on their devices, while the majority of junior students were found to be regular active users that install regular third party apps on their devices. Furthermore, it is noted that the SAUSCE model can be used to gauge how many individuals possess a smartphone and how many don’t, in addition to pointing out what the overall technical proficiency/maturity is of those who are in possession of a smartphone on both an individual and group basis. Finally, despite the perceived technological capability of an audience, assumptions should not be made about their ability to implicitly understand all technical terms during security training/awareness campaigns and explicitly defining or explaining technical terms beforehand assists with completing the task at hand. Overall, this research aims to contribute to the enhancement of user-centred security pertaining specifically to smartphones, by delivering usable, initial results of such an endeavour. © 2018 Curran Associates Inc.

abstract={Over Several years, we observed that our students were sceptical of Software Engineering practices, because we did not convey the experience and demands of production quality software development. Assessment focused on features delivered, rather than imposing responsibility for longer term 'technical debt'. Academics acting as 'uncertain' customers were rejected as malevolent and implausible. Student teams composed of novices lacked the benefits of leadership provided by more experienced engineers. To address these shortcomings, real customers were introduced, exposing students to real requirements uncertainty. Flipped classroom teaching was adopted, giving teams one day each week to work on their project in a redesigned laboratory. Software process and quality were emphasised in the course assessment, imposing technical debt. Finally, we introduced a leadership course for senior students, who acted as mentors to the project team students.

abstract={Previous research found that inexperienced software engineers may tend to view automatic testing as a waste of time and as an activity completely separate from programming. This could have a negative impact on their later careers and could be a sign that improvements in software engineering education are needed when it comes to testing. At the same time, this stance could negatively influence the perception that practitioners have of recent university graduates. To explore this issue, we conducted a qualitative study and surveyed 170 and interviewed 22 practitioners about their experiences with recent graduates, focusing on software testing skills. We find that practitioners do recognize a skill gap between university graduates and industry expectations and that this perception could be engrained deeply enough already to influence hiring practices. Practitioners use different and at times costly strategies to alleviate this skill gap, such as training and mentoring efforts. We validated core findings in a survey with 698 professional software developers. Our qualitative insights can help industry, research, and educational institutions guide in-depth studies that explore the severity of the effects we have found. The coping strategies we have found can provide valuable starting points that can inform changes in how we educate the software engineers of the future. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Context Numerous software design patterns have been introduced and cataloged either as a canonical or a variant solution to solve a design problem. The existing automatic techniques for design pattern(s) selection aid novice software developers to select the more appropriate design pattern(s) from the list of applicable patterns to solve a design problem in the designing phase of software development life cycle. Goal However, the existing automatic techniques are limited to the semi-formal specification, multi-class problem, an adequate sample size to make precise learning and individual classifier training in order to determine a candidate design pattern class and suggest more appropriate pattern(s). Method To address these issues, we exploit a text categorization based approach via Fuzzy c-means (unsupervised learning technique) that targets to present a systematic way to group the similar design patterns and suggest the appropriate design pattern(s) to developers related to the specification of a given design problem. We also propose an evaluation model to assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach in the context of several real design problems and design pattern collections. Subsequently, we also propose a new feature selection method Ensemble-IG to overcome the multi-class problem and improve the classification performance of the proposed approach. Results The promising experimental results suggest the applicability of the proposed approach in the domain of classification and selection of appropriate design patterns. Subsequently, we also observed the significant improvement in learning precision of the proposed approach through Ensemble-IG. Conclusion The proposed approach has four advantages as compared to previous work. First, the semi-formal specification of design patterns is not required as a prerequisite; second, the ground reality of class label assignment is not mandatory; third, lack of classifier's training for each design pattern class and fourth, an adequate sample size is not required to make precise learning. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={On-The-job training of new hires assigned to work in hazardous environments, where making a mistake can have catastrophic consequences, can be extremely dangerous for people, for the environment, and for company assets, and yet hard to schedule and very expensive. On the other hand the traditional training methods (books, manuals, classroom training, as well as e-learning and audio-visuals) do not cover the practical part of training, and are now quite outdated and unwelcome to new generations of workers, the so-called "digital natives". As a result, the design and engineering of training programs which can solve both problems described above, overcoming the safety, logistical and financial difficulties related to training-on-The-job and making it more attractive and engaging for learners, represent a critical challenge for companies in the next coming years. In this paper we present a case study describing an innovative training project based on the use of a Virtual Training Environment (or "VTE" or "simulator") for the training of new hires in a typical O&G working environment. In our simulator, fully developed at Contractor's software labs and tailored to Oil Company specifications, the students came into contact with a simulated immersive 3D virtual world that emulates actual conditions of a drilling land rig, in order to familiarize with the scenario and gain information on its main elements. The trainees were therefore able to perceive the underlying mechanics involved and had the chance to make several attempts, if necessary, to perform tasks without the cost associated with errors in a real situation. Our study points out that also personnel not necessarily assigned to work in the real counterpart of the virtual working environment, such as desk engineers and staff employees, had clear benefits from being trained with the simulator described in this article, in terms of conceptual understanding and learning retention. The method described in this paper has some very interesting innovative features that make it particularly suitable for use as a HS&E training tool. © 2018 SPE All rights reserved.},

abstract={Teaching programming courses in an academic environment has challenges, particularly for undergraduate students. These challenges can also be found in the software industry, where novice developers still need to obtain coding training. In practice, lecturers or trainers always assign exercises to students with the goal of improving their coding skills. Based on teaching experience, we have found that students may need to rely on software development kits to code an application faster, such as reusing lines of code already developed (code snippets) to solve a particular problem. Additionally, to reduce the software development time, novice developers tend to use crowdsourcing and social media sources of example code that can be used to solve programming problems. Utilizing these code snippets not only saves time for students or novice developers but also helps them to learn. Therefore, we proposed a system, called Squirrel, that is capable of offline and online code snippet storage and searching. Additionally, for online functionalities, this application supports searching for code snippets that exist in question-and-answer websites, such as Stack Overflow. We believe that this system will help increase the effectiveness of software development, especially for computer-science students and novice developers.},

abstract={Public speaking anxiety is a type of social phobia, which might be commonly seen in novice software engineers. It is usually triggered by a fear of social performance especially when the performer is unfamiliar with the audience. Today, many software engineering activities (e.g. code inspection, peer review, daily meetings, etc.) require social gatherings where individuals need to present their work. However, novice software engineers may not be able to reduce their performance anxiety during their course of education. In this study, we propose a virtual reality approach to construct a practice environment for improving novice software engineers’ pubic speaking experiences. Consequently, we examine the effects of virtual reality intervention on the public speaking experience of six novice software engineers from a computer engineering department. We designed a virtual auditorium to simulate the presentation delivery environment and findings suggest that using this infrastructure for training purposes can reduce presenter anxiety levels – which is consistent with related published studies. We believe that this virtual auditorium environment can deliver benefits for students and practitioners alike in terms of addressing the anxiety that is often associated with early stage career presenters. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={Code smells are often considered as key indicators of software quality degradation. If code smells are not systematically removed from a program, its continuous degradation may lead to either major maintenance effort or the complete redesign of the system. For several reasons, software developers introduce smells in their code as soon as they start to learn programming. If novice developers are ought to become either proficient programmers or skilled code reviewers, they should be early prepared to effectively identify code smells in existing programs. However, effective identification of code smells is often not a non-trivial task in particular to a novice developer working in isolation. Thus, the use of collaborative practices may have the potential to support developers in improving their effectiveness on this task at their early stages of their careers. These practices offer the opportunity for two or more developers analyzing the source code together and collaboratively reason about potential smells prevailing on it. Pair Programming (PP) and Coding Dojo Randori (CDR) are two increasingly adopted practices for improving the effectiveness of developers with limited or no knowledge in software engineering tasks, including code review tasks. However, there is no broad understanding about the impact of these collaborative practices on the effectiveness of code smell identification. This paper presents a controlled experiment involving 28 novice developers, aimed at assessing the effectiveness of collaborative practices in the identification of code smells. We compared PP and CDR with solo programming in order to better distinguish their impact on the effective identification of code smells. Our study is also the first in the literature to observe how novice developers work individually and together to identify smells. Our results suggest that collaborative practices contribute to the effectiveness on the identification of a wide range of code smells. Our findings can also be used in practice to guide educators, researchers or teams on improving detection and training on code smell identification. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Physical therapists have a history of modifying and making assistive technology (AT) to fit the unique needs of their patients. However, lack of materials, time, and access to training can restrict what they can create. While 3D printing has the opportunity to empower physical therapists to develop highly customized, economical, and timely assistive technology; little is known about the feasibility of using 3D printing in a clinical setting, and how to teach and engage physical therapists in physical prototyping. We collaborated with physical therapy professors and students at a medical university to integrate 3D printing and AT design into a graduate-level physical therapy class. Our investigation showed 3D printing is a viable tool for clinical production of AT. We found opportunities and barriers to 3D printing in the physical therapy field, and we present four considerations relevant to integrating 3D printing into clinical practice: 1) exploring augmentations versus novel AT designs, 2) improvements to novice 3D modeling software, 3) adjusting for prototype fidelity, and 4) selecting 3D printing materials. This paper contributes knowledge toward the understanding of practical applications of 3D printing in a clinical setting and teaching 3D modeling to non-engineers. ©2016 ACM.},

abstract={Teaching practices within educational institutions have evolved through the increased adoption of technology to deliver the curriculum and the use of computers for assessment purposes. For educational technologists, there is a vast array of commercial computer applications available for the delivery of objective tests, and in some instances, organisations have opted to develop bespoke systems to meet their individual pedagogical requirements. However, there is very little research published on the usability of these systems and on the possible usability problems that could ultimately affect users' learning or users' marks in summative tests. This paper focuses on the effectiveness of the heuristic evaluation method for the evaluation of computer-assisted assessment (CAA) systems and proposes a set of CAA heuristics for evaluating assessment tools. The results of these tests show that, with little training, novice evaluators can effectively perform an evaluation and could, using this heuristic set, identify genuine usability problems within the assessment tool. Therefore, educational technologists or software developers could use the new CAA heuristic set to aid their procurement or inform their design decisions. © 2015 British Educational Research Association},

abstract={The student entry phase is the period of a study process in which fundamental technical and non-technical skills should be acquired. The interrelation of those skills is not only crucial for the study process itself. Rather, the systematic, well-reflected methodological usage of specific technical knowledge is a key element for the future professional career after graduation. Unfortunately, during our last years of teaching we noticed that most of the novices in software engineering are neither well equipped with the necessary soft skills, nor can they handle the key technical skills in an appropriate way at the end of their first semester. Therefore, we designed a project that addresses technical and non-technical competencies in an integrated way. In the project, we induce students to actively increase their awareness of their own proficiency in technical and non-technical skills by guided reflection and feedback processes, both individually as well as in a group. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper describes the experience of developing Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) training programby applying an Instructional Design Process(IDP). This is not complete training to become an IV&V engineer, but job training to help solve common problems encountered in IV&V work. The instructional design process featured extensive frontend analysis before the design and implementation of the instruction, and also repeated revision of the instruction. The Dick and Carey model influenced the process used for developing the IV&V training program, which we called J-IDP. We conducted a field trial with the entry level of the training materials, but the resultwas not as positive as expected. Therefore, following J-IDP, we reviewed the materials and revised the training. Our experience with this training program suggests applying an instructional design process may solve some aspects of two common issues for software engineering education or training, the difficulty in identifying necessary abilities for software engineers and the difficulty in maintaining the training up-to-date. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Software engineers learn through experience and training to optimize their software development process through a dynamic cycle of assessment, planning, enactment, and evaluation. When needed, software process improvement (SPI) frameworks (SPIFs) fill in experiential and educational gaps. However, because of the needs that drove their original development, existing SPIFs assume either a specific set of situational criteria or enough software engineering (SE) expertise to select and tailor SE best practices as needed. Outlier projects involving novice software developers or projects with unique concerns are left to find their own path to a quality software product. With such scenarios becoming more prevalent as computing becomes pervasive across society, there is a growing need for flexible, accessible SPIFs that allow decision-makers of all skill levels to efficiently self-drive their SPI efforts according to their individual goals and constraints. This paper outlines how we, as a research community, can and must meet this need by addressing the underlying theoretical, empirical, and practical challenges. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Agile approaches to software development offer flexibility and autonomy to developers, while demanding discipline and attentiveness. At its best, agile constitutes an idealized vision of Wenger's Community of Practice: one where the essence of the software practice is freely negotiated by participants following self-determined trajectories of identity within the community. While agile frameworks prescribe ways of doing, in reality these codified practices must adapt to a real workplace. Nowhere is this more plainly seen than in the onboarding stage of new employees: this is the point where newcomers establish an identity and establish means of participating within the development community. We report on the evolving nature of onboarding and mentoring at a mature software development firm that has practiced Scrum for a decade. As the firm has scaled up to an international purveyor of specialized engineering software and services, the way in which new employees are brought into the community of practice has changed profoundly. We view this history through a series of lenses: those of workplace participants entering the firm at different stages of the firm's history. We follow the history of the onboarding process through the perspectives of several employees, and we focus on the trajectories of certain key employees as their roles change from novice to mentor. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Mutation analysis is a testing strategy that consists of using supporting tools to seed artificial faults in the original code of a software under test, generating faulty programs ('mutants') that are supposed to produce incorrect outputs. Novice programmers suffer of a wide range of deficits due to defective training processes. We argue that the incorporation of experiences on mutation testing in programming courses adds valuable knowledge to the learning process. In this paper we evaluate the effects of using mutation testing to improve the learning process of students in programming courses. We present results of experiments and analysis involving undergraduate students. These experiments are the continuation of a previous work in which we raise empirical evidences that the adequate incorporation of mutation testing in programming courses contributes to form an effective environment that fosters learning. To do so, we provide a mutation testing tool to promote the practice of mutation testing by novice programmers. Through practical experiences and several analysis survey we measured the effects of using the mutation testing criterion to teach programming. In addition, we collected the opinion of senior students who already knew mutation testing concepts about their opinion on the usage of mutation concepts to teach novice programmers. Our findings reveal that the effective use of mutation analysis concepts contributes to the learning process, making students see the code as a product under development that is the result of a careful manual coding process which they need for measuring and predicting the effect of each command. The main contributions discussed in this paper are: (1) presenting results of an empirical analysis involving undergraduate students, thus giving us preliminary evidence on the effects of the novel practice; (2) exposing possible practices to explore mutation testing in programming classes, highlighting the limitations and strengths of such strategy; and (3) a mutation testing tool for educational purposes. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Purpose: To measure gamma and alpha brain wave activity as a measurement of concentration and stress levels during surgical simulator performance of laparoscopic tasks to determine if expert surgeons have different brain activity patterns compared with intermediate and novice surgeons. Materials and Methods: After obtaining Institutional Review Board approval, 1st and 2nd year medical students, urology residents (PGY2-PGY5), and attending urologists from one institution were recruited. Participants were stratified by level of experience and performed laparoscopic tasks on the EDGE laparoscopic simulator. Subjects were evaluated for concentration and stress levels using the electroencephalography (EEG) data extracted from the MUSE™ headband. The MUSE software developer kit (SDK) allowed quantification of gamma and alpha waves during each task. An analysis of variance was used to compare concentration and stress levels between groups. Results: A total of 19 participants were recruited for the study and stratified by surgical experience into novice, intermediate, and expert laparoscopy groups: 6 medical students, 9 urology residents, and 4 attending urologists, respectively. Concentration and stress were quantified by calculating the area under the curve of the gamma and alpha EEG wave tracings. Stress was significantly lower in the attending urologists compared with the residents and medical students during the laparoscopic suturing and trended toward significance in the peg transfer task (P = 0.0003, P = 0.069). Concentration was significantly higher in the expert group compared with the less experienced groups during both the peg and suture tasks (P = 0.036, P = 0.0039). Conclusions: EEG brain activity in more experienced surgeons reveals a significant increase in concentration levels with a decrease in stress during simulated laparoscopic tasks compared with novices. This information may correlate with increased proficiency as well as provide objective feedback of progress along the learning curve with the MUSE SDK. © Copyright 2015, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2015.},

abstract={The recent and fast expansion of OSS (Open-source software) communities has fostered research on how open source projects evolve and how their communities interact. Several research studies show that the inflow of new developers plays an important role in the longevity and the success of OSS projects. Beside that they also discovered that an high percentage of newcomers tend to leave the project because of the socio-technical barriers they meet when they join the project. However, such research effort did not generate yet concrete results in support retention and training of project newcomers. In this thesis dissertation we investigated problems arising when newcomers join software projects, and possible solutions to support them. Specifically, we studied (i) how newcomers behave during development activities and how they interact with others developers with the aim at (ii) developing tools and/or techniques for supporting them during the integration in the development team. Thus, among the various recommenders, we defined (i) a tool able to suggest appropriate mentors to newcomers during the training stage; then, with the aim at supporting newcomers during program comprehension we defined other two recommenders: A tool that (ii) generates high quality source code summaries and another tool able to (iii) provide descriptions of specific source code elements. For future work, we plan to improve the proposed recommenders and to integrate other kind of recommenders to better support newcomers in OSS projects. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Community-based Open Source Software (OSS) projects are usually self-organized and dynamic, receiving contributions from distributed volunteers. These communities' survival, long-term success, and continuity demand a constant influx of newcomers. However, newcomers face many barriers when making their first contribution to an OSS project, leading in many cases to dropouts. Therefore, a major challenge for OSS projects is to provide ways to support newcomers during their first contribution. In this paper, our goal was to evaluate how the newcomers' perceived efficacy is influenced by the use of an environment that organizes the project information for developers who want to place their first contribution to an OSS project. To accomplish this goal, we created FLOSS coach, a portal aiming to support newcomers to OSS projects, which was implemented based on a model of barriers proposed in previous research. Then, we conducted a study, in which 46 students, split in case and control group, were asked to contribute to an OSS project. We assessed the newcomers' self-efficacy by conducting a questionnaire before and after the assignment. We found that presenting the information according to the model of barriers had a positive influence on newcomers' self-efficacy, empowered the newcomers, making them more confident and comfortable during the contribution process. However, there is also some indication that FLOSS coach did not lower the technical barriers. © 2015 IEEE.},

As early as during the conceptual design phase, the specified system models take into considerations the Voice of Customer, the Voice of Business and the Voice of Technology to meet customer expectations, ensure cost effectiveness and enabling new functionality. Following such an approach, clinicians, therapists and engineers work together in order to develop an upper limb disorder part-task trainer which requires knowledge of mechanics, electric/electronics, control technology, software engineering, biology and human anatomy. As an education tool, the part-task trainer can multiply the frequency of novice therapy training at clinical training centres, medical schools and hospitals. © 2015 Penerbit UTM Press.

abstract={Inexperienced developers, for example new graduates joining a software development company, have dificulties applying their software testing knowledge. They lack handson experience and often have a dismissive attitude towards systematic testing, which hinders their adoption of testing activities. If the novice cannot quickly adopt a healthy testing culture during the onboarding phase, her progress as a high-quality engineer may be hindered. Here, cues from social coding sites can potentially help: Simple signs of a team's testing culture can facilitate more testing by contributors. We propose to make the team's testing culture visible by strategically employing traits of social transparency. We introduce six dashboard-like testing signals into the novice's IDE and prominently display how senior developers are testing. A preliminary evaluation with 24 soon-to-be Bachelor graduates showed encouraging results: Being reminded of their lagging test progress induced a need to test more. Visual comparison to colleagues' testing performance woke competitive feelings in students and made them want to write more test. © 2015 ACM.},

Studying open source developers, we found that they rely on a project's pre-existing test code to learn how to write tests and adapt test code for their own use. We propose to strategically present useful and contextual test code ex- Amples from a project's test suite to newcomers in order to facilitate learning and test writing. With an automatic suggestion mechanism for valuable test code, the newcomer is enabled to learn how senior developers write tests and copy it. Having access to suitable tests lowers the barrier for writing new tests. © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={Open Source Software (OSS) projects leverage the contribution of outsiders. In fact, the sustainability of many projects relies on retaining some of these newcomers. Usually these communities do not coordinate the work of the newcomers, who go to the issue trackers and self-select a task to start with. We found that 'finding a way to start' was reported as an important issue by practitioners. To further investigate this specific barrier, we conducted a qualitative analysis with data obtained from semi-structured interviews with 36 subjects from 14 different projects, including newcomers and experienced members. We used procedures of Grounded Theory - open and axial coding - to analyze the data. We found that newcomers are not confident enough to choose their initial task and they need information about the tasks or direction from the community to support choosing a task more suitable for them. We also present a set of strategies identified in the literature, interviews, and state-of-the-practice that can provide newcomers with such information, enabling them to be more confident when choosing their first tasks and collaborate with the community. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Context Numerous open source software projects are based on volunteers collaboration and require a continuous influx of newcomers for their continuity. Newcomers face barriers that can lead them to give up. These barriers hinder both developers willing to make a single contribution and those willing to become a project member. Objective This study aims to identify and classify the barriers that newcomers face when contributing to open source software projects. Method We conducted a systematic literature review of papers reporting empirical evidence regarding the barriers that newcomers face when contributing to open source software (OSS) projects. We retrieved 291 studies by querying 4 digital libraries. Twenty studies were identified as primary. We performed a backward snowballing approach, and searched for other papers published by the authors of the selected papers to identify potential studies. Then, we used a coding approach inspired by open coding and axial coding procedures from Grounded Theory to categorize the barriers reported by the selected studies. Results We identified 20 studies providing empirical evidence of barriers faced by newcomers to OSS projects while making a contribution. From the analysis, we identified 15 different barriers, which we grouped into five categories: social interaction, newcomers' previous knowledge, finding a way to start, documentation, and technical hurdles. We also classified the problems with regard to their origin: newcomers, community, or product. Conclusion The results are useful to researchers and OSS practitioners willing to investigate or to implement tools to support newcomers. We mapped technical and non-technical barriers that hinder newcomers' first contributions. The most evidenced barriers are related to socialization, appearing in 75% (15 out of 20) of the studies analyzed, with a high focus on interactions in mailing lists (receiving answers and socialization with other members). There is a lack of in-depth studies on technical issues, such as code issues. We also noticed that the majority of the studies relied on historical data gathered from software repositories and that there was a lack of experiments and qualitative studies in this area. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Newcomers' seamless onboarding is important for online communities that depend upon leveraging the contribution of outsiders. Previous studies investigated aspects of the joining process and motivation in open collaboration communities, but few have focused on identifying and understanding the critical barriers newcomers face when placing their first contribution, a period that frequently leads to dropout. This is important for Open Source Software (OSS) projects, which receive contributions from many one-Time contributors. Focusing on OSS, our study qualitatively analyzed social barriers that hindered newcomers' first contributions. We defined a conceptual model composed of 58 barriers including 13 social barriers. The barriers were identified from a qualitative data analysis considering different sources: A systematic literature review; open question responses gathered from OSS projects' contributors; students contributing to OSS projects; and semi-structured interviews with 36 developers from 14 different projects. This paper focuses on social barriers and its contributions include gathering empirical evidence of the barriers faced by newcomers, organizing and better understanding these barriers, surveying the literature from the perspective of the barriers, and identifying new potential research streams. © 2015 ACM.},

A novice level programmer must understand how the project flows and learn how to write the document: communication is very important skill for both of the abilities. Minecraft is a very superior SandBox game as an education tool. Its usefulness as an education tool has been proven throughout the world.

abstract={Computer-aided design (CAD) tools are critical in the current fast-paced digital product commercialization environment. As firms move towards a model based enterprise, it becomes more important for engineers to develop the skills necessary to efficiently and effectively model components in CAD. The status of CAD education and training has often been decried as focusing too much on declarative knowledge, namely how to do specific procedures in a specific software program. This is opposed to the strategic knowledge or expertise that is adaptable to other CAD programs. To better inform CAD education and modeling procedures, an understanding of how experts model and model in novel situations is presented. Specifically, and novel to this work, the adaptive nature of these practicing professional's CAD expertise is examined and compared to that of relatively novice students. The methods comprise a combination of screen capture data, model attributes, and the results of interviews to assess adaptive expertise. Practicing engineers are found to spend a smaller percentage of their modeling time engaged in actual modeling procedures (doing time). Significant differences related to model attributes include: practicing engineers being less likely to use pattern features, more likely to have incorrect feature terminations, and more likely to use more complex features (as measured by feature density). Results show practicing engineers as less likely to highlight strategies related to adaptive expertise prior to the modeling activity. Post interview results show practicing engineers with more manifestations of adaptive expertise. These results are in agreement with previous literature examining both general and CAD modeling expertise. Copyright © 2015 by ASME.},

These laws are known as "laws of technical systems evolution" from the TRIZ theory. The aim of this paper is to propose an approach facilitating the use of the evolution laws, as part of a framework for innovation. To achieve our goal we start by an analysis of each definition of the three first evolution laws. It's analysis we'll permit to extract with precision part of the definition we'll use to construct a model helping the use of the laws. The model we propose is composed of a short quiz that users must answer. The purpose of these questions is to guide the user as far as possible in the identification of functional elements of the system and possible developments of innovative products, as recommended by the three first laws. After that, we'll conduct an experimentation to taste this model on two kinds of participants, some of them are software developers working in different companies, they do not know the TRIZ theory. The other participants are students in training who learned some tools to innovate, they are not completely novices on TRIZ. To conclude, we'll present the relevance of our approach to use systematically the first 3 evolution laws of TRIZ. © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Inexperienced software developers - for example, undergraduates entering the workforce - exhibit a lack of testing skills. They have trouble understanding and applying basic testing techniques. These inexperienced developers are hired by software companies, where this lack of testing skills has already been recognized. Companies allocate valuable resources and invest time and money in different onboarding strategies to introduce new hires to the organization's testing practices. However, if the lack of testing skills is not addressed properly, the new hire is left to her own devices. This hinders her in becoming a high-quality engineer for the software company. This thesis proposes to improve the onboarding strategies with traits of social transparency in order to specifically address testing issues of inexperienced new hires. Social transparency has been shown to influence the testing behavior of development teams on a social coding site. An environment that is open for discussion helps newcomers to understand and adapt a team's testing culture. Tailoring the onboarding process to better address testing skills of new hires makes it more effective and more efficient. This reduces the danger of carrying new hire's testing deficits into commercial software development. © Copyright 2014 ACM.},

abstract={Context: Onboarding is a process that helps newcomers become integrated members of their organisation. Successful onboarding programs can result in increased performance in conventional organisations, but there is little guidance on how to onboard new developers in Open Source Software (OSS) projects. Goal: In this study, we examine how mentoring and project characteristics influence the effectiveness and efficiency of the onboarding process. We study a collaboration program involving a total of nine Open Source Software projects and more than 120 students from different universities around the world as part of Facebook's Education Modernization Program. Method: We use quantitative measurements of source code repositories, issue tracking systems, and discussion fora to examine how newcomers become contributing members of their OSS projects. Results: We found that developers receiving deliberate onboarding support through mentoring were more active at an earlier stage than developers entering projects through conventional means. Also, we found that project size and lifetime influenced onboarding. Conclusion: Empirical decision support can contribute to a more effective onboarding process in OSS projects. Mentor support in critical stages can accelerate the process, but project maturity is also a significant factor that increases the effect of onboarding. © 2014 ACM.},

abstract={The adoption of innovative Software Engineering (SE) processes by an organization implies that engineers have to learn new processes which they might not be familiar with. Social software can support and enhance this adoption process, so research needs to focus on how the exchange of knowledge among software engineers using these tools can help to perform training more effectively. We propose a framework based on social software to support the collaborative learning, adoption and improvement of SE processes through the exchange of experiences among individuals. This article examines factors influencing the adoption of new SE processes and the quality of the experiences shared using the proposed framework in comparison with similar ones. Two case studies were carried out involving junior engineers in a training course on agile software development. Anonymous surveys collected data on the perceived quality of the experiences shared during the research, their usefulness, and the simplicity of the mechanisms provided to contribute experiences. Results show that the adoption of new SE processes is influenced by several factors such as the commitment of software engineers to collaborate in the adoption of the new process, the perceived level of usefulness of the tacit knowledge elicited during the adoption process, the diversity of the topics covered by the shared knowledge, the simplicity of the mechanisms to contribute new tacit knowledge, and the amount of learning achieved by software engineers. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={The disproportionately large number of traffic accidents of young novice drivers highlights the need for an effective driver education program. The Goals for Driving Education (GDE) matrix shows that driver education must target both lower and higher levels of driver competences. Research has indicated that current education programs do not emphasize enough the higher levels, for example awareness and insight. This has raised the importance of insight programs. On the Road (OtR), a Flemish post-license driver education program, is such an insight program that aims to target these higher levels. The program focus is on risky driving behavior like speeding and drink driving. In addition, the program addresses risk detection and risk-related knowledge. The goal of the study was to do an effect evaluation of this insight program at immediate post-test and 2 months follow-up. In addition, the study aimed to generalize the results of this program to comparable programs in order to make usable policy recommendations. A questionnaire based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) was used in order to measure participants' safety consciousness of speeding and drink driving. Moreover, we focused on risk detection and risk-related knowledge. Participants (N = 366) were randomly assigned to a baseline - follow-up group or a post-test - follow-up group. Regarding speeding and driving, we found OtR to have little effect on the TPB variables. Regarding risk detection, we found no significant effect, even though participants clearly needed substantial improvement when stepping into the program. Regarding risk-related knowledge, the program did result in a significant improvement at post-test and follow-up. It is concluded that the current program format is a good starting point, but that it requires further attention to enhance high level driving skills. Program developers are encouraged to work in a more evidence-based manner when they select target variables and methods to influence these variables. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Software development is a knowledge intensive activity. Software engineers need to gather domain knowledge to be able to successfully deliver a software system. In particular, novice software engineers need to acquire enough knowledge to perform their tasks. This means that knowledge transfer to novice software engineers must be quickly and effectively performed to facilitate the onboarding process. One way to understand the knowledge transfer process is by analyzing the software development context and the involved team members. Such analysis enables the development team to determine key aspects that can influence knowledge acquisition by novice software engineers. This can also allow the identification of possible strategies that minimize the effort employed by the team members during this process. This paper presents a qualitative study about knowledge transfer in a small software organization from the point of view of software practitioners. Our results suggest that software developers have several knowledge sources and novice engineers learn when they observe organizational procedures and when the tasks have detailed guidelines. In addition, we identified that developers carry out most steps of the knowledge creation process defined by Nonaka and Takeuchi. We believe our results can support other software organizations to improve the sharing of knowledge and learning practices. Copyright © 2014 by Knowledge Systems Institute Graduate School.},

abstract={This paper considers the use of social learning networks to increase the productivity of IT consulting companies. We advocate that using a carefully designed social learning network can reduce the learning time for enterprise software developers and consultants. By viewing learning as a social act, a consulting company can increase its productivity. Increased productivity is based on hastening the learning process. The focus of this paper is to identify the ways in which social networks catalyze the process of knowledge sharing in order to increase the productivity in the enterprise resource planning (ERP) consulting sector. We present a set of detailed practical results that were obtained from experiments with an original knowledge sharing method that was applied to training young software developers to enable them to work for some of the world's most demanding IT companies. The experimental data were collected from 2004 to 2011 during 12 training sessions conducted by an IBM partner in conjunction with the Computer Science Department of a large Eastern European University. The main results of this study were: (1) designed a learning community that reduced the time needed to insert junior consultants into ERP projects; and (2) statistical data were generated that measured the increase in productivity that an ERP consulting company could obtain by employing organizational learning networks. We also discuss the positive impacts of social networks that can be established between private companies and universities. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Mentoring project newcomers is a crucial activity in software projects, and requires to identify people having good communication and teaching skills, other than high expertise on specific technical topics. In this demo we present Yoda (Young and newcOmer Developer Assistant), an Eclipse plugin that identifies and recommends mentors for newcomers joining a software project. Yoda mines developers' communication (e.g., mailing lists) and project versioning systems to identify mentors using an approach inspired to what ArnetMiner does when mining advisor/student relations. Then, it recommends appropriate mentors based on the specific expertise required by the newcomer. The demo shows Yoda in action, illustrating how the tool is able to identify and visualize mentoring relations in a project, and suggest appropriate mentors for a developer who is going to work on certain source code files, or on a given topic.

abstract={While modularity is highly regarded as an important quality of software, it poses an educational dilemma: the true value of modularity is realized only as software evolves, but student homework, assignments and labs, once completed, seldom evolve. In addition, students seldom receive feedback regarding the modularity and evolvability of their designs. Prior work has shown that it is extremely easy for students and junior developers to introduce extra dependencies in their programs. In this paper, we report on a first experiment applying a tool-supported architecture review process in a software design class. To scientifically address this education problem, our first objective is to advance our understanding of why students make these modularity mistakes, and how the mistakes can be corrected. We propose tool-guided architecture review so that modularity problems in students' implementation can be revealed and their consequences can be assessed against possible change scenarios. Our pilot study shows that even students who understand the importance of modularity and have excellent programming skills may introduce additional harmful dependencies in their implementations. Furthermore, it is hard for them to detect the existence of these dependencies on their own. Our pilot study also showed that students need more formal training in architectural review to effectively detect and analyze these problems. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={In recent years, minimally invasive arthroscopic surgery has replaced a number of conventional open orthopedic surgery procedures on joints. While this achieves a number of advantages for the patient, the surgeons have to learn very different skills, since the surgery is performed with special miniature pencil-like tools and cameras inserted through little incisions while observing the surgical field on video monitor. Therefore, virtual reality simulation becomes an alternative to traditional surgical training based on hundreds years old apprentice-master model that involves either real patients or increasingly difficult to procure cadavers. Normally, 3D simulation of the virtual surgical field requires significant efforts from the software developers but yet remains not always photorealistic. In contrast to this, for photorealistic visualization and haptic interaction with the surgical field we propose to use real arthroscopic images augmented with 3D object models. The proposed technique allows for feeling the joint cavity displayed on video monitor as real 3D objects rather than their images while various surgical procedures, such as menisectomy, are simulated in real time. In the preprocessing stage of the proposed approach, the arthroscopic images are stitched into panoramas and augmented with implicitly defined object models representing deformable menisci. In the simulation loop, depth information from the mixed scene is used for haptic render- ing. The scene depth map and visual display are reevaluated only when the scene is modified.},

It is important for a software organization to understand how novice developers perceive the role and importance of usability evaluation. This will permit development of effective methods and training programs that could potentially increase the application of usability evaluation. The results suggest that the perspectives of novice software developers about usability are characterized by a clear understanding about what usability evaluation is and a clear awareness about obstacles and advantages. However, our study also reveals certain shortcomings in the "usability culture" of novice developers, especially about the users' role in usability evaluation. Despite this limited "usability culture", novice developers' understanding of usability evaluation reflects a positive opinion about their participation in these activities. In addition, novice developers think that usability, in a general sense, is an important aspect of their work. © The Authors.},

abstract={Vanderbilt University introduced a new course in the 2012 Fall Semester: Cyber-physical vehicle modeling, design and development. This course focused on the design, development, fabrication, verification, and validation of a scale vehicle in the virtual and the physical domains to meet a set of realistic and challenging design requirements for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Model-Based Amphibious Racing Challenge. The students built a series of models in software and hardware to guide the design choices for the 1/5th scale amphibious vehicle. The culmination of this course was a competition against teams from other universities in January 2013 that compared the vehicle's actual performance with student-created simulation models. This was an elective course outside the traditional capstone design curriculum and consisted of a team of juniors and seniors across the disciplines of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer engineering, computer science, and physics. The students received robust training "to be an engineer" with many activities that can't be included in a typical classroom environment: hands-on experience designing, modeling, and building a complete vehicle; simultaneously solving several open ended, rigid deadline challenges; and navigating complex team dynamics in a full end-to-end project. Additionally, the students gained experience using modern engineering modeling tools from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's META tool suite under development for the Fast, Adaptable, Next-Generation Ground Vehicle program. The META tool suite is a set of free, open source tools for compositional design synthesis at multiple levels of abstraction, design trade space exploration, metrics assessment, and probabilistic verification of system correctness. This work details the course activities and summarizes the lessons learned from a pedagogy perspective. Copyright © 2013 by ASME.},

Inadequate training could likely lead to project delay or failure. In this paper we propose an approach, named Yoda (Young and newcOmer Developer Assistant) aimed at identifying and recommending mentors in software projects by mining data from mailing lists and versioning systems. Candidate mentors are identified among experienced developers who actively interact with newcomers. Then, when a newcomer joins the project, Yoda recommends her a mentor that, among the available ones, has already discussed topics relevant for the newcomer. Yoda has been evaluated on software repositories of five open source projects. We have also surveyed some developers of these projects to understand whether mentoring was actually performed in their projects, and asked them to evaluate the mentoring relations Yoda identified. Results indicate that top committers are not always the most appropriate mentors, and show the potential usefulness of Yoda as a recommendation system to aid project managers in supporting newcomers joining a software project. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Since their wide adoption by the software engineering community in the mid-90's, design patterns have become an important educational component in the training of novice software engineers due to the common belief that, as distilled experience of seasoned software designers, they can transform novice software engineers into skilled professionals in a relatively short time frame. This paper questions the validity of this commonly-held belief about the educational value of conventional patterns, arguing that although there is tremendous value in capturing and disseminating software engineering experience in the form of patterns, conventional design patterns cannot deliver on this expectation to significantly shorten the experience growth curve. We report initial results from an ongoing research project that aims to not only identify the difficulties in using conventional patterns as educational means for novices, but also to use such insights to develop new forms of patterns to help educators and experts to more effectively communicate and transfer their software engineering knowledge, experience, and understanding of best practices to novices. © 2012 IEEE.},

To render software products understandable and maintainable, proper identifier naming is a key issue that needs to be addressed. It is well known that proper identifier naming influences the readability and understandability of the source code, and thus many researchers have discussed the influence of identifier naming on the quality of source codes.The education of novice programmers toward becoming high quality systems engineers should therefore include training in proper identifier naming. This paper proposes a way to teach proper identifier naming in a collaborative learning environment that offers both majority rule and subject design based on a software development process view.},

abstract={Want a great software development team? Look no further. How to Recruit and Hire Great Software Engineers: Building a Crack Development Team is a field guide and instruction manual for finding and hiring excellent engineers that fit your team, drive your success, and provide you with a competitive advantage. Focusing on proven methods, the book guides you through creating and tailoring a hiring process specific to your needs. You'll learn to establish, implement, evaluate, and fine-tune a successful hiring process from beginning to end. Some studies show that really good programmers can be as much as 5 or even 10 times more productive than the rest. How do you find these rock star developers? Patrick McCuller, an experienced engineering and hiring manager, has made answering that question part of his life's work, and the result is this book. It covers sourcing talent, preparing for interviews, developing questions and exercises that reveal talent (or the lack thereof), handling common and uncommon situations, and onboarding your new hires. How to Recruit and Hire Great Software Engineers will make your hiring much more effective, providing a long-term edge for your projects. It will: Teach you everything you need to know to find and evaluate great software developers. Explain why and how you should consider candidates as customers, which makes offers easy to negotiate and close. Give you the methods to create and engineer an optimized process for your business from job description to onboarding and the hundreds of details in between. Provide analytical tools and metrics to help you improve the quality of your hires. This book will prove invaluable to new managers. But McCuller's deep thinking on the subject will also help veteran managers who understand the essential importance of finding just the right person to move projects forward. Put into practice, the hiring process this book prescribes will not just improve the success rate of your projects-it'll make your work life easier and lot more fun. © 2012 by Patrick McCuller.

abstract={The retention of newcomers is of vital relevance for initiatives developing Free Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS). Based on previous FLOSS research which repeatedly highlights the amount of knowledge developers build in the beginning of their project participation for their continuance and experiences from the organizational domain, we evaluate the use of mentoring as an appropriate knowledge transfer and retention strategy for FLOSS projects. Combining FLOSS and organizational literature, we develop our research model and hypothesize that (i) mentoring facilitates novices in their learning, which, in turn, increases their retention (ii) and (iii) that mentoring has direct effects on protégés continued participation. The evaluation of 91 newcomers to the KDE project supports our hypotheses and finds a strong direct and indirect association between mentoring and novices project retention. On the one hand our analysis shows that mentoring significantly increases novices achieved level of knowledge after their ramp up period which, in turn, enlarges their project permanence. On the other hand, we find evidence that there is also a strong and significant direct association between mentoring and protégés retention behaviour, which could be the result of the strong interpersonal relationship which is formed between mentors and protégés.},

abstract={Beginning in 1992, China began to conduct research on additive manufacturing (AM) (i.e., rapid prototyping manufacturing or solid freeform fabrication). These studies included three main areas: processes, equipment, and applications in different fields. At the same time, various educational initiatives in AM were also begun. Regarding the first area, a number of courses related to AM are now being offered in universities and colleges, and not just in those that have already developed research programs on AM, such as Tsinghua University, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, and South China University of Technology, as well as some higher vocational schools. Owing to the orientation of these colleges and schools, their focus tends to be on the practical applicability of the courses they offer. In addition to the lectures they offer, all of these universities and colleges are equipped with a laboratory or resources for experiments, and have brought in equipment on which students can practice operating software (3D CAD. etc.) and make prototypes of their own design. Along with the development of AM research in China, the proportion of equipment in Chinese production is increasing as well. Moreover, these courses offer lectures, employ Ph.D. students as teaching assistants for undergraduate or junior college students, and also offer training related to creative design and manufacturing for postgraduates. This training has produced good results, in that it requires postgraduates to combine what they have learnt during lectures with their own research. In addition, associations and companies have played an important role in the development of AM in China by interacting with society and offering a number of seminars and workshops. There are many companies that offer courses for people with specific interests, and courses for engineers and technicians have created a boom in AM in China's automobile industry. A number of associations and companies have even jointly organized design competitions in vocational schools. When students participate in these competitions they become familiar with the advanced technology of AM, an experience that is very important for their future work.},

This paper tries to know the vision that novice requirements engineers have about the effectiveness of requirements elicitation techniques and compare it with the requirements experts' vision. To carry out the comparison, repertory grid technique was used. This technique allows knowing indirectly the subject's opinion on the techniques. The results show a substantial difference between both visions with regard to the techniques and elicitation context. This implies that a more extensive training, and primarily practice, is necessary in order for novice engineers to recognize differences in techniques effectiveness and decide with greater certainty about the most appropriate techniques to use in requirements elicitation sessions.},

abstract={Concept mapping software is emerging as a powerful tool for supporting complex thinking. The Decision Rationale editor (DRed) provides an illustrative example from industry. Eight years after its development, 700+ engineers in Rolls- Royce have received direct training, others have adopted it independently and it is increasingly used for knowledge management, creativity and communication. This study seeks lessons from these experiences to inform broader map-based tools and methods development. Semi-structured interviews were performed with 11 professionals ranging from junior engineers to chief designers. A qualitative analysis of transcripts and sample maps examined the value of new features and methods in practical contexts. Results suggest mapping is often the "path of least resistance" to organise unstructured ideas and conflicting perspectives. The flexible nature of maps, however, presents challenges for standardising methods.

E-PRAGMATIC network (E-Learning and Practical Training of Mechatronics and Alternative Technologies in Industrial Community) unites 17 partners from seven European countries in a common effort to modernize mechatronics vocational training of the professionals, apprentices and trainees. Modern educational approaches and distance learning modules with remote access to the working stations will be integrated in the in-company training of network's industrial partners. The training will be prepared by the educational partners and carefully balanced to meet the concrete needs of the enterprises. Based on the experience, the education methods for organizing and executing in-company training on distance will be developed. This contribution presents the network and the results of the extensive empirical knowledge and skills needs study of the professionals employed in the E-PRAGMATIC network's industrial members.

In our fields, the main challenges are characterized by the deep and tight naturally fractured carbonate reservoirs, volatile fluids, high-pressure-high-temperature conditions and the presence of CO2 and sour gas. Production enhancement activities play a significant role in maintaining production capacity. Therefore, rapid and integrated decisions from multidisciplinary teams are necessary to select potential solutions and to accelerate the required remedial work. Yet the largely junior population of the asset teams creates an immense challenge in getting the work completed. Overcoming this challenge begins by developing individual staff learning programs that are aligned with competency gaps, business needs and personal development plans. The program lists the competencies required, which are then achieved through blended learning. The learning program emphasizes transferring knowledge and skills on the job, and holds the learner accountable for achieving results. Therefore, linking training with relevant and appropriate task assignments is essential to accelerate and reinforce competency development. One task which has proven key in the blended learning methodology is conducting formal and detailed well reviews, in which all pertinent data is presented on a specific well, and a multi-disciplinary team brainstorms and recommends an action plan and the additional. Staff assigned to conduct well reviews must develop knowledge outside their domain in order to facilitate team collaboration among the different disciplines, allowing the sharing of best practices and optimum decision making. This accelerated staff development method has been applied for two years in North Kuwait and has resulted in meeting our production goals, better field management and improved team performance. Some examples of activities enabled by this methodology are defining perforation intervals, developing sector reservoir models to determine shut-in periods required for buildup testing, and formulating workover program design. In these two years 12 workover programs have been completed successfully - is an outcome of 66 well reviews. Just as importantly, junior staff competency grew 48%, an achievement which is mainly the result of their being assigned and performing jobs such as well data analysis and well reviews with minimum supervision. This paper details the method and progress of what has proven to be the best approach to accelerating staff learning curves, reducing competency gaps and enhancing professional development that delivers. Also summarized is the value of team collaboration, interaction between engineers and geosciences for successful reservoir management, and lessons learned.

abstract={Executable and Translatable UML enables Model-Driven Architecture by specifying Platform-Independent Models that can be automatically transformed into Platform-Specific Models through model compilation. Previous research shows that the transformations result in both efficient code and consistency between the models. However, there are neither results for the effort of introducing the technology in a new context nor on the level of expertise needed for designing the Platform-Independent Models. We wanted to know if teams of novice software developers could design Executable and Translatable UML models without prior experiences of software modelling. As part of a new university course we conducted an exploratory case study with two data collections over two years. Bachelor students were given the task to design a hotel reservation system and the necessary test cases for verifying the functionality and structure of the models within 300 hours, using Executable and Translatable UML. In total, 43 out of 50 teams succeeded in delivering verified and consistent models within the time frame. During the second data collection the students were given limited tool training. This gave a raise in the quality of the models. Due to the executable feature of the models the students were given constant feedback on their design until the models behaved as expected, with the required level of detail and structure. Our results show that using Executable and Translatable UML does not require more expertise than a bachelor program in computer science. All in all, Executable and Translatable UML could play an important role in future software development. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Since its inception, the undergraduate program in Computer Engineering from the Universidad Autonoma de San Luis Potosi in Mexico has been characterized for their hard work throughout the student's education. This work has placed this academic program at the first position in the national ranking, according to the national evaluation center (CENEVAL) of Mexico. To achieve this, an important factor has been the pattern of development of reseedgeh and technological development in most of their courses. The software projects are prerequisites for entitlement to qualifying. This paper analyzes a sample of projects developed over fifteen years (1995-2009) to assess quality and identify their strengths and weaknesses. We analyze the evolution of software quality in terms of stage developer training throughout their academic progress and the changes in general characteristics of the software developed over the period analyzed. The first analysis allows us to draw conclusions about the development of student potential, and the second one to evaluate the development of academic programs and apprenticeship schemes.

Method: Fieldwork was carried out in a 2-year training course in agile development. This was validated in two phases (with and without PAL), which were subdivided into two stages: Training and Project. Results: The study demonstrates that, on the one hand, the learning process can be facilitated using PAL to transfer software process knowledge, and on the other hand, products were developed by junior software engineers with a greater degree of independence.

abstract={Intelligent software algorithms are increasingly becoming a tool in consumers' daily lives. Usability problems can persist even for software designed with human-centered design principles, especially when the software replaces or augments intelligent human capabilities. Most computer games with substantial user communities have forums and websites hosted either by the game developer or third parties that offer strategy guides, walkthroughs, and sometimes in-game scenarios to help novices learn the system. An important first step in developing an EUG for a system is to identify the specific gaps in understanding that can be translated into learning objectives. The effectiveness of identifying a tool's boundary conditions has its limits, which we learned from observing a group of trainees. The goal of an EUG is to provide reference and training guidance for navigating the cognitive challenges of intelligent software tools.},

abstract={Most managers today do not know what specific kind of knowledge the individuals in their organization possess. As firms become larger, more knowledge intensive, and more globally dispersed, the need for managers to "know what we know" is more acute. Thus, a common initiative within the tacit knowledge management approach (Sanchez, 2001) is usually some effort to improve understanding of who knows about what in an organization. A tacit knowledge approach may lead to improvements in employee satisfaction and motivation, when an organization "officially" recognizes, validates and makes visible in the organization the kind of knowledge that individual workers claim to have (Sanchez, 2001). In this sense, a investment in the certification of professional competences represent one of the available alternatives to adjust the workforce to flexible work processes demands, responding to social and labour rights compliance needs, possibly leveraging personal understanding and organizational action capabilities (Alexim & Lopes, 2003; Cegielski, 2004; Rainbird, 2001). Certification of competencies is a widespread and growing trend in labour markets. In the IT sector, the question of whether certified individuals are better able to perform in an IT job-role is a workplace learning and performance management current relevant issue. The purpose of this study was to determine how IT professionals perceive certification programs as a professional training alternative, and the kind of effect the effective participation in one of the programs has in that judgment, and in the motivation necessary to enable certification learning activities, ultimately making a tacit knowledge management strategy "available". Presently, any individual can claim to be an "expert" in a particular process, subject matter or technology. In fact, one disadvantage in the tacit knowledge approach is that individuals in an organization may claim to have knowledge that they do not actually have or may claim to be more knowledgeable than they really are. Despite this fact, qualifications and credentials have long served as signals for organizations. As some authors put it, certifications are double-edged, as they can also be used as "credentials" to gain prestige and influence, having nothing to do with competence development, as they are valued as impression management or self-presentation strategies. The data for this exploratory study was gathered from a 58 employee sample of a Portuguese-based multinational software engineering company. An experimental Competence Certification Effects Scale (CCES) was used, and after a consistency analysis, the original 22 items were reduced to 17, grouped in a 4-factor structure: "Certification Intrinsic Value"; "Certification as Training"; "Career Management"; and "Effort Trade-off". Cronbach's alphas were .81, .81, .83, and .81, respectively. In short, the findings of the study indicate that there is a significant difference in the perceived usefulness of a certification, if an employee participates or not in a dedicated certification program. This difference is more significant in more senior, management-related roles, as for junior engineers that don't participate in a certification program, this participation isn't seen as a professional development anchor or a valid education driver. The study further points out that certification programs tend to be judged in an instrumental way, for extrinsic motivation reasons, more by its positive effects in terms of career management or professional within-peers recognition, than by its intrinsic value as institutional learning or knowledge management anchors or personal development drivers.},

abstract={The transfer of entire projects to offshore locations, the aging and renewal of core developers in legacy products, the recruiting in fast growing Internet companies, and the participation in open source projects, present similar challenges of rapidly increasing newcomer competence in software projects. In particular, culture differences, communication complexity, and the rapid influx of developers with little or no project knowledge common in these phenomena pose practical and research questions for software engineering. For example, how do different cultures impact project learning? Are there best practices for competence-enhancing communication? How to learn from the experiences of top developers to improve the training of newcomers? What resources and tools can be provided to help newcomers learn faster and become more productive? These questions sketch a project-learning-focused agenda needed to address outlined challenges. We propose how emerging measurement methods utilizing rich data in software repositories and the theoretical frameworks based on cognitive and organizational science may be applied to address these challenges and to improve understanding of how humans learn.

abstract={During the Formulation phases of the NASA Project Life Cycle, communication systems engineers are responsible for designing space communication links and analyzing their performance to ensure that the proposed communication architecture is capable of satisfying high-level mission requirements. Senior engineers with extensive experience in communications systems perform these activities. However, the increasing complexity of space systems coupled with the current shortage of communications systems engineers has led to an urgent need for expedited training of new systems engineers. A pilot program, in which college-bound high school and undergraduate students studying various engineering disciplines are immersed in NASA's systems engineering practices, was conceived out of this need. This rapid summer-long training approach is feasible because of the availability of advanced software and technology tools and the students' inherent ability to operate such tools. During this pilot internship program, a team of college-level and recently-hired engineers configured and utilized various software applications in the design and analysis of communication links for a plausible lunar sortie mission. The approach taken was to first design the direct-to-Earth communication links for the lunar mission elements, then to design the links between lunar surface and lunar orbital elements. Based on the data obtained from these software applications, an integrated communication system design was realized and the students gained valuable systems engineering knowledge. This paper describes this approach to rapidly training college-bound high school and undergraduate engineering students from various disciplines in NASA's systems engineering practices and tools. A summary of the potential use of NASA's emerging systems engineering internship program in broader applications is also described. ©2010 IEEE.},

The research reveals how Google empowers programmers to "feel at home" using company coding practices, as well as maximizing peer-learning and collaborative practices. These practices reduce isolation, enhance collegiality, and increase employee morale and job satisfaction. Research limitations/implications: The case study describes the practices in one company. Practical implications: The research documented in the paper can be used as a benchmark for other onboarding and practice-based learning set-ups. Originality/value: This is the first research that gives insights into the practice-based learning and onboarding practices at Google. The practices are assessed to be state-of-the-art and the insights therefore relevant for benchmarking exercises of other companies. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={This paper demonstrates that different software code inspection techniques have the potential to improve developer understanding of code being inspected to varying extents. This suggests that some code inspection techniques may be superior to others with respect to improving the efficacy of future inspections, harnessing collective wisdom, and extending team knowledge and networked intelligence. In particular, this paper reports results from a study of novice developers' cognitive development during a software inspection training exercise. We found that developers who performed a code inspection prior to modification tended to operate at higher cognitive levels beginning very early in the modification exercise. Those who had not performed an inspection tended to operate at lower cognitive levels for longer periods of time. Results highlight the importance of code inspections in increasing developers' understanding of a software system. We believe collaboration between academia and industry in studies such as these would benefit the three major stakeholders: academia, industry and graduates. © 2009 ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social-Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

Ruby on Rails™ was specifically designed for the development, deployment, and maintenance of database-backed web applications. It is flexible, customizable, and easy to learn. With a relatively little initial training, a novice programmer can create a robust web application in a small amount of time, without the need of a software consultant.

abstract={Transitions from novice to expert often cause stress and anxiety and require specialized instruction and support to enact efficiently. While many studies have looked at novice computer science students, very little research has been conducted on professional novices. We conducted a two-month in-situ qualitative case study of new software developers in their first six months working at Microsoft. We shadowed them in all aspects of their jobs: coding, debugging, designing, and engaging with their team, and analyzed the types of tasks in which they engage. We can explain many of the behaviors revealed by our analyses if viewed through the lens of newcomer socialization from the field of organizational man-agement. This new perspective also enables us to better understand how current computer science pedagogy prepares students for jobs in the software industry. We consider the implications of this data and analysis for developing new processes for learning in both university and industrial settings to help accelerate the transition from novice to expert software developer.

abstract={When people my age were in college, the calculator of necessity was the slide rule. From that statement, you can determine my age and that of my generation. We didn't know at the time but the use of the slide rule was preparing us as students for the life of the engineer with a great intuition as to what made sense relative to decimal point, units, and a gut sense as to the correctness of an answer. A student couldn't take forever to obtain the solution to a homework assignment or a quiz answer and there was no use for a «what if» results should I tinker with this or tinker with that. Rough approximations and rounding of numbers was a way of engineering practice. Within a very few years of starting my career as an Engineer-In-Training and then as a professional engineer Hewlett Packard produced the most amazing (slide rule) calculator. I recall waiting with anticipation as the price came down from over $700 so that I could open the piggy bank to spend $ 435 for my HP. With our background from training with the slide rule, the calculator didn't make us callus, it made us more efficient. We carried into that new electronic generation a strong background in understanding of the principals in getting it right. Then came those huge chugging main frames that produced reams of paper that no one really wanted to look through nor had the time to; we were still using approximations to make sure that we got it right. You may recall sitting in front of the key punch after you worked out your fortran code, essentially writing your own software to analyze a beam. 300 cards later, stuffed into the chugging main frame you had your «what ifs» and thought this is really great. Some of us thought that was the utmost in technology until software engineers began to produce sub routines that we could buy off the shelf and put into the mainframe. As technology ramped up and moved along it warp speed, main frames reduced to desk tops and then to lap tops and now to Black Berry size, along with new problems. Small buttons and small screens, my eye sight has gotten worse and my fingers larger, but that's another story. Education has followed suit with large computer laboratories in engineering schools that require students to work on sophisticated computer equipment having no idea how the equipment was developed, using software they have no clue as to its limitations, and all assisting in the creation of students and instructors having almost blind faith in a console. They apply «what ifs» to engineering problem until they think they've got it right. This can be somewhat unnerving for seasoned practitioners when reviewing work of new hires who have just provided a W8 steel section to span some unusual length without realizing that it is going to be like a spring board. But that being said, technology is fast coming to the engineers aide by putting warnings and flags on output that force the engineer to question what's going on. The new technology is creating in many areas a greater reliance on the black box. But is this wrong? Are we engineering relics responding or reacting in a certain way because our training and development process was different? Astronauts put their total faith in the black box. We think it unbelievable that we are seeing pictures of the surface of Mars sent to us by the Mars Lander, that as adolescences were only stories of fantasy. Every day we step into jet liners that can take off and land without any humor intervention.

abstract={In recent years, China has come up with policies to boost its software industry. The policies emphasize technology innovation, the training of professional talents and service improvement. The government will invest more in the software industry, encourage venture capital, cut taxation on software, and create more channels for software businesses to raise funds. As early as 2001, China's Ministry of Education authorized 35 local universities to run pilot software institutes to meet the increased demand for software personnel in the 21st century. University and research institutes enhance software-related education by giving students opportunities to learn about modern technology. The institutes work cooperatively with their international counterparts, improve their teaching methods, use foreign text books and adopt bilingual teaching. The institutes will recruit junior and senior undergraduates who major in software, undergraduates applying for a double major, and graduates with a bachelor's degree or above in software. It is reasonable to believe that having more software 'Made in China' will become a major target of the Chinese government. This talk will give more details of these developments, mainly focusing on software engineering education in the universities and software engineering training in companies in China, including what courses are taught, and the fields most in demand by employers.},

abstract={As new engineering analysis software codes for mechanical engineers become available, it is incumbent upon academic programs to introduce students to these tools and for the students to develop at least rudimentary skills in the application of these codes. The issue that arises is how to effectively introduce these tools into a curriculum that is already crowded. As engineering programs struggle to find accommodations, many students reach their senior year before realizing an opportunity to apply these sophisticated analysis methods- frequently with little or no training. A recurring example is that of students' a priori construction of a system component followed by a perfunctory stress analysis using a commercial computer code. Often the analysis performed is irrelevant or incomplete. The notion of analysis being an essential element in the design process can be lost in the minds of many students. Therefore, the ME department faculty at SDSM&T together with campus partners are integrating into the traditional junior-level core curriculum project-based software applications and tools such as FLUENT and ABAQUS. This paper discusses a proposed option to the traditional offering of an undergraduate course in heat transfer. The method proposed brings project-based learning and analysis applications into the classroom in a novel way. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2007.},

abstract={The author discusses an interdisciplinary approach to helping students learn to write a system requirements specification (SRS). This approach has been refined during use over the last three years and involves students in the first quarter of their junior year. Software engineering students enrolled in a required requirements course act as the requirements team over an eightweek period while biomedical engineering students who are ready to begin the requirements phase of their capstone design project act as clients. Each of the requirements and client teams consists of four to six members. The experience was documented in ASEE conference papers in October of 20041 and June of 20052. Benefits of the process and its placement in the curriculum include requirements engineers and clients being of approximately equal academic and professional maturity and the clients having done substantial technology and problem domain research but no product design. Additionally, the requirements are written for a real product that the clients will design and implement over the coming 21 months. This paper discusses methods used to foster this collaboration, including team training given to the software engineers, assignments given throughout the quarter, interim process review meetings with all involved parties, and the development of rubrics for evaluating presentations and the final SRS. Results are presented and discussed, along with a look at student assessment of the course over three years. Finally, conclusions are drawn from the third iteration of this collaboration and future work is discussed. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2006.},

In an industrial setting, this makes it available to managers and customers. In the educational setting, it becomes possible to teach the techniques to novices before they have learned any programming. It is intended for those who require some deep understanding of the synergies of agile methodology. Extreme Construction is a game that is both fun and informative.

abstract={George Latour considers himself a good leader. As CEO of Retronics, George has a mandate to grow revenues with an eye toward taking the software-engineering firm public by 2006. At the behest of the chairman of the board, he has hired a new marketing director, Shelley Stern-"a thoroughbred" who, the chairman insists, just needs a little training in the business. George does his best to bring his new hire up to speed. He has Shelley sit in on developers' meetings, has her accompany the sales force on client calls, and even has the CFO explain the company's cash flow situation to her. He also takes pains to help her correctly position marketing and press materials. But Shelley never seems to really take the bit. In fact, Shelley considers George's hands-on management style oppressive, and she's dreadfully unhappy. What George sees as efforts to bring her up to speed, like making her go on those sales calls when she has other work to do, she views as signs that he doesn't trust her judgment. What's more, Shelley is spread too thin.

abstract={Agile methods such as extreme programming (XP) are becoming increasingly important for the rapid development of software applications. However, there is a tradeoff in using agile methods. Often they lack in providing a systematic guidance (i.e., a sound description of roles, artifacts, and activities), and thus, require disciplined and experienced developers. Are the promised benefits of agile methods still valid if they are applied by novice (student) developers? To gain some experience, we performed a study on teaching students agile software development with XP. Students performed a small software development project at the University of Kaiserslautern to collect some lessons learned. One result is that although agile approaches are easy to learn and quickly produce results, they are not the best starting point in training software development. The quality of the resulting system, at least in our experience, heavily depends on the discipline of the developers and their background and experience in software development. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.},

abstract={The primary ingredient for successful simulations of dynamic events is•understanding the physical problem for which a solution is needed;•having or obtaining a keen knowledge of the computational tools;•gaining experience in the use of that computational tool, preferably under the tutelage of a senior engineer or scientist. Such codes are in no way "black boxes" which can be taken off the shelf and used by anyone. Each has its own characteristics and eccentricities and it takes time-six months to two years-to become thoroughly familiar with a given code. The best approach to acquiring these skills is to:(a)Study the basic theory of finite elements, finite differences and other computational techniques used for continuum mechanics, preferably in formal college courses.(b)Study, either in formal courses or on your own, the basic principles of continuum dynamics, which should include structural dynamics, thermodynamics, material behavior at high strain rates, wave propagation, shock wave physics and mathematical physics.(c)Acquire fundamental modeling skills under the guidance of experienced colleagues or supervisors.(d)Become familiar with the constitutive descriptions, numerical models, computational approaches and idiosyncrasies of the particular computer programs you will be using. The above implies that it would be foolhardy to assign a junior engineer to a structural dynamics or wave propagation code and expect him or her to generate, in short order, the types of results seen in the literature. Commercial codes required 15-25 man-years of development. Their effective use requires a minimum commitment of six months to two years just to set up the code on an in-house computer and learn to use it with a reasonable degree of competency. This is after the educational requirements listed in (a) and (b) above have been met. More often than not, considerable on-the-job learning in physics goes on while the code is being mastered. During this period, adherence to a "one person-one code" philosophy is necessary. Equally necessary is contact with other experienced code users or code developers during the learning period. Mandatory is the acquisition of material data for the constitutive equations employed in the code determined from wave propagation experiments at strain rates appropriate for the problems being addressed. Assuming all this has been done-it almost never is-there remains the problem of rendering the results of code computations in usable graphical form. While most current wave codes are readily transportable, post-processing routines are still highly device-dependent. The color slides and movies produced readily at one installation may require a major investment in graphics hardware at another. All this is not meant to discourage you from the use of structural dynamics or wave propagation codes. In a later chapter, you will see some outstanding results obtained with present-day codes on technologically difficult problems. It is intended to remind you that the use of codes is a non-trivial exercise. Successful implementation of a computational capability in any organization implies a commitment to manpower, training and investments in hardware and software, which may not be obvious at first glance. Successful use of the codes inevitably entails tradeoffs between accuracy and economy. The rest of the book strives to give you the background necessary to understand the nature of the computer programs used to solve problems in dynamics and to evaluate and use those results intelligently. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Open source/free software can be extremely powerful and valuable at little or no cost. Student familiarity with open source/free software will be essential for success in the future computer science environment. It does, however include some risks: heterogeneous network security concerns, a steep learning curve, and frequent bureaucratic restrictions to overcome. This project overcame these concerns while providing a powerful suite of open source tools to interested students at no cost. More specifically, the software package adheres to security constraints of the institution's existing Windows-based network. Accompanying the package is an easy to follow, web-based instruction manual allowing novice users to install a dual-boot Linux/Windows operating system configuration. Specialized programs validate user authorization and align Linux with existing network security settings. This product answered a genuine need to provide students the opportunity to learn about Linux and its benefits as a fully-featured, application-rich, alternative operating system. The paper includes the results from the initial implementation and fielding of the distribution in the dormitories as well as the specific development, design, and implementation details. The paper will provide a guide to engineers and educators who wish to broaden their computing abilities and opportunities by integrating new computer technologies into an existing network environment. It will describe the analysis, process, and problems associated with selecting and implementing software for a heterogeneous network with administrative concerns. The presentation will include a demonstration of the software package and the web based training program.},

abstract={The operation of electrical power system is inherently dynamic. Under normal operating conditions, the electrical system is near equilibrium with minor deviations from steady state due to small, nearly continuous changes in loads. During faults conditions, instantaneous changes in the electrical system occur, and generators may encounter sufficient variations in rotational speed that can loose synchronism with the power system. There are scores of computer programmes that analyse the dynamic behaviour of generators solving the corresponding electro-mechanical equations together with the electrical network. However, the rather inherent complexity of transient analysis and the lengthy solutions renders the topic less appealing to many learners. Despite the validity and comprehensive transient simulation computer programs available to engineers and consultants, they remain, more often than not, complex to the novice, taking little advantage of the advances in multimedia and visual effects. This paper covers some of the key issues facing online courseware development followed by a description of an online multimedia based transient simulation tool to get the transient concepts across to students and novice learners and provide them with meaningful understanding of generator transients through stimulating simulated practice.},

abstract={This paper describes the Collaborative Apprenticeship Learning Object Toolkit (CALOT), a generalized architecture that forms the basis of a family of computer tutoring systems. The toolkit, based on previous work, utilizes the apprenticeship model of learning as the basis of the design of a computer tutorial system for the study of the operational procedures where theory and practice are both of importance. Systems built from the CALOT library teach complex operational procedures in a safe, simulated environment that allows students to explore relevant theoretical concepts in the context of their current activity. In addition, systems built upon the CALOT architecture can be utilized by multiple, non-co-located students in a synchronous manner - meaning that each student can run their own tutorial, and through a server every action taken by one student is immediately rebroadcast to the other students' tutorials. In this way a distributed set of students can collaborate on the tutorial in real-time. The development of this type of computer tutorial system is driven by the goal of linking theoretical knowledge with practical operational experience. Active, exploratory, apprentice-style learning is supported via modes of operation within the system. The student can flexibly choose to `observe the expert' perform and explain operational steps, or `act as an apprentice' and carry out the steps autonomously. The student can switch between these modes at their discretion, giving the student control of the level of intervention by the system. Furthermore, the student can explore and reflect on an `information space' of object designations, procedures, and related concepts. Two examples tutorials based on the CALOT architecture are the Collaborative Virtual Spectrometer (CVS) and the Virtual X-Ray Diffractometer (VXRD), which teach nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction, respectively. Finally, BAUEN (Basic AUthoring ENvironment) is described. BAUEN is a graphical user interface system that is intended to help the software developer designer author a CALOT-based computer tutorial system with maximum efficiency, focusing the developer's efforts on domain content, and not on system implementation.},

abstract={The Engineering Learning Center (ELC) of Kansas State University provides internship opportunities for engineering students in the same way a teaching hospital trains medical school students. The center consists of state-of-the-art manufacturing and engineering design hardware and software, a staff of experienced engineers, and a group of faculty associates from various engineering disciplines. In this center graduate and undergraduate students from Engineering and Business colleges work as interns on product and process development projects contracted with industrial partners. To each project contracted with client companies an interdisciplinary group of interns is assigned to work under the supervision of an experienced staff member and deliver new designs, prototypes and manufacturing processes. This operation provides a unique and innovative active learning environment for junior and senior students from several engineering disciplines. Students learn to perform as members of an interdisciplinary team, develop outstanding communication skills (because they have to sell their ideas to a paying customer), and realize the business side of engineering activities. This paper presents the detailed results of the operation of ELC since its inception in 1995. It also details the lessons learned in establishing and operating this center with a guide for things to emphasize and pitfalls to avoid.},

abstract={This project addresses the need to train CAD users on proper modeling methodology. New CAD software empowers designers with the flexibility of parametric or variational design. These feature-based parametric modeling packages allow modification of a solid model by changing its dimensional parameters; however, incorrect modeling methodology may cause failure in the design stage. Failures occur when modified dimensions cause a conflict within the geometry of the model. An option being used is to train designers on capturing the Design Intent of a system through proven techniques in the modeling process. This training is based on interactive computer sessions that guide the designer and allow him/her to explore what-if scenarios. This project sought to identify proven techniques in the modeling process for capturing the Design Intent of mechanical systems. The familiar components of a bicycle provided a basis for exploration. Pro/Engineer software was used in this study. Nine lessons were created and tested by professionals.

abstract={Learning interface agents search regularities in the user behavior and use them to predict user's actions. We propose a new inductive concept learning approach, called IBHYS, to learn such regularities. This approach limits the hypothesis search to a small portion of the hypothesis space by letting each training example build a local approximation of the global target function. It allows to simultaneously search several hypothesis spaces and to simultaneously handle hypotheses described in different languages. This approach is particularly suited for learning interface agents because it provides an incremental algorithm with low training time and decision time, which does not require, from the designer of the interface agent, to describe in advance and quite carefully the repetitive patterns searched. We illustrate our approach with two autonomous software agents, the Apprentice and the Assistant, devoted to assist users of interactive programming environments and implemented in Objectworks-Smalltalk-80. The Apprentice learns user's work habits using an IBHYS algorithm and the Assistant, based on what has been learnt, proposes to the programmer sequences of actions the user might want to redo. We show, with experimental results on real data, that IBHYS outperforms ID3 both in computing time and predictive accuracy.},

Two workstations have been placed in each of the ten districts, and are linked to the Dallas mainframes and supercomputer vi a existing communications. These workstations are being used by novice and expert users, and are based around the IBM PS/2 Model 80 microcomputer. Differences in peripherals and software depend upon whether the primary user is a geologist or a reservoir engineer. The basic strategy is to provide a computing environment for the technical professional 11 casual 11 user, with the emphasis on interactive use of 11 fingertipll computing power to mechanize current operational activities. Wherever possible, interactive rapid on-screen response is provided so that the technical professional can test sensitivities and determine the consequences of actions and changes in parameters. The expected result of this computing environment is a) higher quality professional output, b) improved technical capability, and c) increased productivity. It is stressed throughout that evaluation of the input, and the interpretations and resultant decisions are the responsibility of the technical professional. The workstation is a modest cost, selfcontained computing environment readily available to the technical professional, with mainframe access to data and supercomputer access for computations requiring that capability. The configurations include digitizers, plotters, and storage devices, along with a fully configured CPU. Commercially available software is provided with each workstation, and it is intended to use 11mass market11 software in this computing environment to the greatest extent possible. Only a minimum amount of internal software was developed, primarily to integrate the packages and the utilities. All workstations include contouring and volumetrics software. For the Reservoir Engineer 1 s workstation, software for conducting reservoir simulation problems on a supercomputer was also provided. While the overa11 program has spanned three years, pilot testing of the workstation and software began in earnest in 1986. As experience was gained, certain hardware and software decisions were made, and field testing was begun in early 1987. The resultant configuration was determined and frozen, and deployment of the workstations in the district offices was begun in November 1987. Before distribution, a one week initial training program on the actual system was he 1 d for about 40 engineers and geologists. Response from the technical professionals, including many novice users, has been favorable.

Our efforts to support this translation involve the object-oriented tool ADAM (Active Design and Analyses Model) that allows graphical and interactive language-independent design which is complemented with multiple language-specific code generators (i.e., Ada83, C++, Ontos-Ci+, with Modttla-3 and Ada9X in the plsrtning stages) that automatically provide a significant portion of the application's code. ADAM will be employed during 1993-1994 in our junior year software engineering sequence to investigate the integration of object-oriented design and Ada83. We tdso believe software engineers who are familiar with Ada83, but not with Ada9X or the object-oriented approach can utilize ADAM to learn Ada9Xs language syntax and semantics by contrasting the generated Ada9X and Ade83 code for the same object-oriented design (another goal of our research and education efforts). This paper examines many of the aforementioned issues, with a focus on translation of an ADAM-created object-oriented design into Ada83 code. © 1993 ACM.},

MicroWorld Creator facilitates experiential learning by making simulations more participatory in two important ways: it increases the user's control over the input to the simulation, and it displays output in formats that are familiar to the user. The software encourages repeated exploration of simulation models by providing a consistent environment that enables simulation users to orient themselves quickly when moving from one simulation to the next and enables simulation developers to create different simulation interfaces in a short amount of time. © 1992.},

abstract={This paper reports on a computer-based design environment, known as DESMATE, which has been developed using Apple's Hypercard software. DESMATE exists as a rich database of information useful for the design of electronic circuits, together with facilities that allow for the rapid access and manipulation of this information. However, DESMATE is also a tool capable of both tracking the detailed activities of an engineer working within the design environment and of subsequently analysing the resulting activity traces. At present DESMATE is being used to collect traces of individual expert and novice engineers pursuing a high-level design from a given requirements' specification. Some preliminary data are presented here and discussed in relation to existing models of design processes. In addition, the broader potential applications of DESMATE are highlighted, including its use as (i) a metric for assessing design technique and capability and (ii) an intelligent training aid for educating student engineers about different design strategies. © 1992 Butterworth-Heinemann Ltd.},

abstract={The paper reports the actions taken by a large Swedish information technology business to repair defects in the production of system software. Typical problems were late delivery, poor maintainability, lack of documentation. The approach taken to remove the defects consisted in introducing into software production the time‐ and specification‐oriented culture of the factory. Software writing had usually been delegated to more or less autonomous individuals inside R&D, with the result that expertize was often unrecorded, residing in those individuals' brains, procedures were poorly documented, cross‐fertilization with other projects was minimal and lead times were long. The authors identify three reasons for this situation: management ignorance of how the design process operates; professional exclusiveness of design staff; reluctance of managers to exercise supervision over a design engineer's daily tasks. The solution was to differentiate and rationally define jobs within the design function, set up a flat managerial structure overseeing a group of integrated teams each consisting of a senior system designer plus a junior designer leading four semi‐skilled technicians, introduce a well‐defined work‐flow organization, make use of quality circles, install review procedures, undertake leadership and interpersonal skill training, and take measures to ensure effective communication in all directions. The new approach has partly been successfully operated for several years. The paper concludes with a discussion of some of the positive and negative lessons which have been learnt during the implementation. Copyright © 1990, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

abstract={Designing effective interactive courseware to teach computer graphics to Computer-Aided Design (CAD) users, from entry-level drafters to senior engineers, requires a step-by-step methodology. Proper training can provide long-term improvement in production rates and cost savings. The question is how to provide the most effective training. A host of problems inherent with traditional training methods, from poor scheduling and class logistics to questionable course content, may decrease learning rates. The majority of existing software documentation can serve as reference, but is usually inadequate as an instructional tool. Classes provided by the vendor are too short-averaging one week. An effective way to solve many of these problems is to use the Computer-Aided Design system itself to deliver the instruction. Computer-Assisted Instruction (CAI) offers many benefits over conventional stand-up lecture or textbook methods. CAI in itself, however, is not sufficient, since the courseware must indeed teach what it is supposed to teach to be of any value. One useful systematic method to help ensure a quality CAI program is found in the Instructional Systems Development (ISD) model. The ISD model is a five-phase procedure based on general systems theory. First, the specific jobs or tasks for which the trainees are being prepared are analyzed. Next, the design phase of the instruction is started by outlining the training objectives as derived from the task analysis. Learning strategies are developed around the existing skill level of the trainee. The instruction is delivered, and an evaluation instrument is created to determine effectiveness. © 1986.},
